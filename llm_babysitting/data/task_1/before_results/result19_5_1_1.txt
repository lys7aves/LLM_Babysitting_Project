Let's begin by comparing the two images and interpreting the mathematical expression correctly.
The expression appears to be:
∑
x=1
10
(cos
x
(
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
))
This is a summation where 
x takes on integer values from 1 to 10. For each 
x, we calculate 
cos
x
 of the argument 
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
.
Now, before calculating the expression, it is crucial to note that 
cos(
2
πx
) will be zero for all odd integers 
x, since 
cos(π/2)=0,cos(3π/2)=0, and so on. Therefore, for odd values of 
x,
