To start, let's examine the mathematical expression given in the images. The expression appears to be a sum, indicated by the sigma notation, with the index of summation running from 1 to 10. The function being summed involves sine and cosine terms, with an argument involving π (pi). I will first transcribe the expression into a form that can be processed for calculation:
x=1
∑
10
sin
