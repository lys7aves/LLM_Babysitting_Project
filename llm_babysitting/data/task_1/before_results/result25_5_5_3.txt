The sum of the 
sin(x) from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is 
sin(1)+sin(2)+sin(3)+sin(4)+sin(5)+sin(6)+sin(7)+sin(8)+sin(9)+sin(10), which is a sum of sine values at different integer points.
The calculation of the nested expression 
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
) from 
x=1 to 
x=10 simplifies to exactly 
π when evaluated.
So, the answer is approximately 
π, which is about 
3.142.
