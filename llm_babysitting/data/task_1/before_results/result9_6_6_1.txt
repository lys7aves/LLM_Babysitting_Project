The two images depict the same mathematical expression, which is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
The lattice on the second image is used for precise location information, but the expression remains unchanged. Now, let's calculate this expression. Since 
sin(π⋅(x+
2
3
)) will yield a simple pattern because 
sin is periodic with period 
2π, and we are evaluating it at half-integer multiples of 
π, which will result in the function alternating between 1 and -1 for integer values of 
x. Let's compute the sum. 
The sum of the given expression evaluates to 0. Therefore, the answer is 0.
