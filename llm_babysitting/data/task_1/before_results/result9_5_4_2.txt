The OCR has not successfully extracted the text from the images as mathematical symbols can often be challenging to interpret for text recognition software. I will attempt a different approach by manually inspecting the images to ensure accurate reading of the equation.
Let me take a moment to manually analyze the images. 
Upon manual inspection of the images, the equation is identified as:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
Now let's solve this equation. This is a summation of the sine function applied to a series of values incremented by 
π. The sine function has a period of 
2π, so over the interval from 
x=1 to 
x=10, the input to the sine function will cover multiple full periods plus an additional 
3/2π, which leads to repeating values. We can calculate each term individually and sum them.
The answer is 
0.
This result is due to the periodic nature of the sine function and the specific values it takes at half-integer multiples of 
π. The sine of 
π×(x+3/2) for integer values of 
x will always result in sine taking values of 
1, 
−1, or 
0, and in this case, the positive and negative values cancel each other out perfectly, leading to a sum of zero.
