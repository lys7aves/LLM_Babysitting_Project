To begin with, I will compare the two images by examining the mathematical expression they contain and ensure it's read correctly for calculation.
The expression looks like it is a summation where 
x goes from 1 to 10. Inside the summation is a cosine function 
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
).
Now let's calculate this expression step by step. We will evaluate the inside of the cosine for each value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then calculate the cosine of that result, summing it all up at the end.
The answer is 
5.0.
