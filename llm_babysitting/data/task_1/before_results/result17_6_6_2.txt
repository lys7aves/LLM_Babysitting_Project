The expression from the images is a summation, which I will interpret and then calculate:
x=1
∑
10
cos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
sin(πx)
⎠
⎞
Let's break this down step by step:
The summation sign 
∑ indicates that we are adding up the values of the cosine function for 
x from 1 to 10.
Inside the cosine function, we have a fraction.
The numerator of the fraction is 
sin(πx).
The denominator of the fraction is itself a fraction: 
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
.
To calculate this expression, we will evaluate the fraction inside the cosine for each 
x from 1 to 10, and then sum up the cosine values. Let's proceed with the calculation.
It seems that the computation resulted in an undefined value (NaN - Not a Number). This could happen due to an indeterminate form within the calculation, such as division by zero. To resolve this, I need to carefully analyze the expression for any values of 
x that might cause a division by zero within the denominator of the fraction inside the cosine function.
The denominator of the fraction inside the cosine function is 
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
. This would be zero whenever 
sin(
2
5πx
)=0. Since the sine function is zero at integer multiples of 
π, we need to check if there are any integer values of 
x between 1 and 10 for which 
5
2
5πx
 is an integer multiple of 
π.
Let's analyze and identify if there are such values of 
x in the range given. 
The values of 
x that would make the denominator of the fraction within the cosine function zero are 
x=2,4,6,8, and 
10. These are exactly the values where 
sin(
2
5πx
)=0, leading to a division by zero.
Therefore, for these values of 
x, the expression within the cosine is not defined, which explains why the summation resulted in an undefined value.
Since the summation includes undefined terms, the entire sum cannot be evaluated in the standard sense. In mathematical terms, the sum is not convergent due to the presence of undefined terms.
The answer is undefined due to division by zero in the terms for 
x=2,4,6,8, and 
10.
