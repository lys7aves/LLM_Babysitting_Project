Let's start by comparing the two images to ensure that we can read the mathematical expression accurately.
Looking at the original image, we have a mathematical expression that consists of a summation. The summation sign 
Σ indicates that we are summing the terms 
cos
x
(
2
πx
) from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
The expression inside the summation is 
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
.
To calculate this expression, we need to evaluate the cosine term for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, multiply each by 
πx and then by 
1
2
1
, and finally sum all the terms together.
Now, let's proceed with the calculation step by step.
The answer is approximately 
−9.42.
