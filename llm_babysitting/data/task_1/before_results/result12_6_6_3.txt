The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not yield any text from the images provided. This is often the case with mathematical expressions or images that contain non-standard text formatting.
Since the OCR has failed to read the expressions, I will proceed by manually inspecting the images to interpret the mathematical expression.
Let's first compare the images to ensure we have the correct expression by manually inspecting the image with the lattice for precise location information. Then, I will calculate the expression. I will proceed with this step now. 
Upon manual inspection of the image with the lattice, the expression is clear:
∑
x=1
10
((−7)
x
−9)
I will now calculate the value of this expression step by step. This involves calculating the power of -7 for each value of 
x from 1 to 10, subtracting 9 from each result, and then summing all the results. Let's compute this. 
The answer is 247,165,752.
