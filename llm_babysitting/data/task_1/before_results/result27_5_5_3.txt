It appears that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not successfully read the text from the images. This can sometimes happen with mathematical expressions, as they can be complex for OCR tools to interpret correctly.
Given that the OCR attempt was not successful, I will manually inspect the images and interpret the mathematical expression for calculation. Let's proceed with that. 
After manually inspecting the images, the mathematical expression given is:
x=1
∑
10
sin
x
(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
Now I will calculate this expression step by step and provide the result. This involves computing the sine of the cosine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, raising the result to the power of 
x, and then summing all of these results. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The answer is 
5.0.
