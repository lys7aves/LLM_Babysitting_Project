The OCR has failed to accurately read the mathematical expression from the images. This can happen due to the complexity of mathematical notation, which OCR software often struggles with.
Since I cannot correctly extract the text from the image using OCR, I will visually inspect both images to ensure the accuracy of the expression and then proceed with the calculation. Let's start by visually examining the images to understand the expression correctly. 
After visually inspecting the images, I can confirm that the mathematical expression is consistent across both. The lattice on the second image is intended to provide a guide for precise location information, but it does not alter the mathematical expression.
The expression is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
I will now calculate this expression step by step. 
The calculated sum of the given expression is approximately 
−2.14×10
−14
, which is essentially zero within the precision limits of floating-point arithmetic used in the calculation.
The answer is approximately zero.
