Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue processing the images using OCR; the operation took too long and was automatically interrupted. This can happen if the image is complex or the OCR engine struggles to interpret the contents accurately. I will attempt a different approach to analyze the mathematical expression and calculate it. Let's start by manually examining the image content. 
The images have been displayed for manual inspection. However, I cannot visually see the images. Instead, I will proceed with another strategy to analyze the images by breaking down the expression into smaller parts and computing them step-by-step. If the expression is in the form of a sum, integral, product, or another compound mathematical operation, it will be tackled piece by piece.
Let me attempt to parse the expression in a more manual manner by inspecting the structure of the mathematical expression within the code environment. 
Unfortunately, analyzing the pixel distribution without the context of the image's content does not provide any helpful information to deduce the mathematical expression.
Since the initial approach to read the expression using OCR was interrupted and the subsequent strategy did not yield useful information, I'm unable to directly analyze the image content to read and calculate the expression.
To proceed, I could attempt to use a mathematical approach if you could provide me with the mathematical expression in text form.
