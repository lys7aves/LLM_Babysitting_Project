The OCR results are not entirely clear, especially for the second image with the lattice. However, it appears that both expressions are intended to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
(x+1), which is a standard arithmetic series.
Let's proceed to calculate the sum of 
(x+1) from 
x=1 to 
x=10. The expression inside the summation can be simplified as 
x+1, and we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate this.
The sum of an arithmetic series can be found
