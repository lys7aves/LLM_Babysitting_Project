The OCR has failed to correctly interpret the mathematical expression from the images. Given that the expression is complex, OCR software may struggle with the intricacies of mathematical notation. I will proceed with manually interpreting the mathematical expression from the original image to ensure accuracy.
The expression appears to be:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
3
−1))
)
I will now calculate this expression. 
The answer is exactly 5.
