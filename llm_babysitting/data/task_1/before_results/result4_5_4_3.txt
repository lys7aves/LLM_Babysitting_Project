Let's start by examining the provided image and reading the equation. I'll do this step by step, comparing the two images for accuracy. Once the equation is correctly read, we can proceed to solve it.
The OCR has not successfully captured the mathematical expression accurately. Given this, I will manually inspect the image and interpret the equation from the image provided. Let's proceed with this. 
After examining the image manually, the equation can be interpreted as follows:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2x+5
1
))
)
This is a summation expression, where the sum is taken from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine of half the product of 
π and the cosine of 
π times 
x plus the fraction 
2x+5
1
.
Now that we have the correct equation, let's proceed to solve it. The solution will involve calculating the expression for each value of 
x from 1 to 10 and then summing those values.
The answer is approximately 
0.0089 after evaluating the summation of the given mathematical expression.
