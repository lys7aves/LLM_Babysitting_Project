The text extraction from the images did not yield readable results, which is not uncommon with mathematical expressions as they can be complex for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to interpret accurately. Since I cannot extract the text directly, I will visually inspect the images to read and interpret the mathematical expression myself.
Let me manually analyze the images to understand the expression. 
After manually inspecting the images, the mathematical expression can be interpreted as:
x=1
∑
10
(6x⋅(sin(
2
πx
)+10)
4
1
−8)
Now that I have the correct expression, I will calculate its value. Let's proceed with the computation. 
The answer is approximately 507.918.
