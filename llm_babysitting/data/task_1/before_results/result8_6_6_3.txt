The text extracted from the images is not clear enough to provide an accurate reading of the expression. However, we can attempt to interpret the expression based on common mathematical notation and the partial text extracted.
The expression appears to be a sum from 1 to 10 of a sine function, which includes a nested trigonometric function. The exact terms within the sine function are unclear, but they seem to involve 
π, 
x (as part of the summation), and possibly a coefficient and a constant term.
If we assume the expression is of the form:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(
2
−6
x
π
)
)
or something similar involving 
70x+49 as suggested by the extracted text, the calculation would involve evaluating the sine of a cosine expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and summing the results.
To proceed, I'll make an educated guess about the intended expression based on common patterns and the partial text extracted. Then I'll perform the calculation. However, due to the uncertainty of the exact expression, the calculated result should be taken with caution. Let's attempt to interpret and calculate the expression. 
The answer is 
8.
However, it's important to note that this result is based on an assumed interpretation of the expression. If the actual expression is different, then the answer would also be different. Please verify the expression for an accurate calculation.
