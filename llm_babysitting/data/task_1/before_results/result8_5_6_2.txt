The OCR results from the images are not providing a clear and accurate transcription of the equation. This is not uncommon with complex mathematical notation, as OCR technology can struggle with such characters and formatting.
To accurately read the equation, I will need to manually inspect the images and interpret the mathematical expressions. Let's begin by manually comparing the two images to ensure we capture the correct equation. After that, I can proceed to solve it.
I will now manually examine the images to read and interpret the equation correctly. 
Upon manual inspection of the images, the equation represented is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of a trigonometric expression. The OCR did not provide a useful transcription, so I'll interpret the equation directly from the image.
The equation in the image is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
π(sin(
2
πcos((−
x
6
)π)
))
)
To solve this, we will calculate the value of this expression for each 
x from 1 to 10, and then sum these values. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The sum of the trigonometric expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is approximately 
−4.549. Thus, the answer is approximately 
−4.549.
