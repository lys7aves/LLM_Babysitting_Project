To solve the given mathematical expression, let's first accurately transcribe it based on the lattice provided for precise location:
The expression seems to be a fraction where the numerator is a large product of sine functions and the denominator is 2. Within the product, there is a summation from 1 to 10 of 
sin(x), and this summation is multiplied by another sine function that has an argument involving yet another sine function.
However, without clearer details or a higher resolution image, I cannot accurately determine the arguments of the sine functions. Could you please provide a clearer des
