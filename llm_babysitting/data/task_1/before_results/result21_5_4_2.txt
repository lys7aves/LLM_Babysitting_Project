The OCR process failed to correctly read the equation from the images. This is not uncommon with mathematical notation, as it can be complex for OCR software to interpret correctly. Instead, I will manually inspect the images to determine the mathematical expression they represent. Let's do this step by step.
First, I will carefully compare the two images you've uploaded to ensure I transcribe the equation accurately. Then, I'll proceed with solving the equation. Please hold on for a moment while I examine the images. 
I've inspected the images and the equation they represent is as follows:
x=1
∑
10
cos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
2
π(x+
2
3
)
)
⎠
⎞
This is a summation equation where we are summing the cosine of a given expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10. To solve this, we will calculate the value of the inner expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, take the cosine of the result, and sum all these cosine values.
Let's proceed to calculate this sum. 
The answer is approximately 4.440158403262126.
