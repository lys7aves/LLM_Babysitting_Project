Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue with processing the images provided, as the operation to extract the text from the images took too long and was automatically interrupted. This could be due to the complexity or quality of the images, or limitations in the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process.
Since the OCR process was not successful, I will attempt a different approach. I'll manually inspect the images based on the provided grid information and then perform the calculation. Let's proceed with that. 
With the image displayed, it's clear that the mathematical expression is as follows:
∑
x=1
10
(10x−50)sin(
2x
6
1
π
)
This is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the function 
(10x−50)sin(
2x
6
1
π
).
Now I will calculate this expression. 
The answer is approximately 35.166.
