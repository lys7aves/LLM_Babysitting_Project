It appears that the OCR has not been able to correctly interpret the mathematical expression from the images. This is not uncommon with complex mathematical notation, as OCR technology can sometimes struggle with such details.
Since OCR did not work as intended, I will proceed to manually interpret the expression based on the first image you uploaded. The expression looks like a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of the cosine of 
πsin(
2
π(x
3
)
−1) divided by 
2. Let me calculate this manually. 
The calculated value of the given expression is approximately 
4.537.
So, the answer is approximately 
4.537.
