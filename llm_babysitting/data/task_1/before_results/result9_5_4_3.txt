To start, I will compare the two images to ensure the equation is read accurately. Then I will proceed to solve the equation. Let's first look at the images to confirm the equation.
It seems that the optical character recognition (OCR) has not successfully read the equations from the images. Given this, I will manually inspect the images and determine the equation for computation. Let's proceed step by step.
I will begin by manually interpreting the equation from the image with the lattice, as it has grid lines that might help in ensuring accuracy. After confirming the equation, I will solve it. The equation appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
Now, I will compute the value of this summation. 
The answer is 0.
