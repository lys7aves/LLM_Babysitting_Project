It seems that the optical character recognition (OCR) process was not able to correctly identify the text from the images you've provided. This can sometimes happen due to the quality of the images, the presence of grid lines, or the complexity of mathematical notation which OCR software may not always handle well.
Since I can't extract the text from the images automatically, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression you have uploaded based on my capabilities to view images.
The expression you've uploaded is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the term 
(10+x−2x). This simplifies to the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
(10−x).
Let's calculate the sum. 
The answer is 45.
