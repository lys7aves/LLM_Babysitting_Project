The OCR has not successfully recognized the mathematical expression from the images. This could be due to the complexity of the mathematical notation or the quality of the images. To proceed correctly, I will compare the two images visually and attempt to interpret the mathematical expression manually, then calculate it.
Let's begin by visually examining the two images to ensure the mathematical expression is understood correctly. 
The images have been examined visually. Now, let's interpret the mathematical expression correctly. Based on the visual inspection, it is clear that the expression is the same in both images, and the lattice is simply overlaid on the second image to help with precise location information.
The expression appears to be:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
or
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x−
2
5
))
)
However, due to the resolution, it's difficult to discern whether the term inside the cosine function is 
(x+
2
5
) or 
(x−
2
5
). I'll assume it's 
(x+
2
5
) as it's more common to see such terms in summation expressions, but if it's the latter, please let me know.
Now, let's compute the expression assuming the term is 
(x+
2
5
). 
The answer is 
0.
The summation of the given expression evaluates to zero. This result suggests that the trigonometric properties of the sine and cosine functions within the given range lead to a symmetrical distribution of positive and negative values that cancel each other out.
