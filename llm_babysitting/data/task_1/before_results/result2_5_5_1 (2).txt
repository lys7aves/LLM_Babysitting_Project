It appears that the optical character recognition (OCR) process did not successfully extract the mathematical expression from the images. This sometimes happens due to the quality of the images or the complexity of the content.
Since OCR did not work, I will proceed by interpreting the mathematical expression based on the initial image description:
The expression is a summation:
x=1
∑
10
(10+x−2x)
This simplifies to:
x=1
∑
10
(10−x)
Now, I will calculate the value of this expression step by step. 
The answer is 45.
