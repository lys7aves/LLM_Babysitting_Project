The OCR has not provided a clear transcription of the mathematical expression from the images. To proceed accurately, I will manually inspect the images to identify and interpret the expression correctly before performing the calculation.
Let's begin by examining the original image to read the mathematical expression correctly. After that, I'll perform the necessary calculation. 
Having examined the original image, the expression is a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of the function:
x
2
−sin((−
2
5
)sin(
2
πx
))π
Now I will calculate this expression, summing the function's value for each integer 
x from 1 to 10. 
The answer to the expression is approximately 386.88.
