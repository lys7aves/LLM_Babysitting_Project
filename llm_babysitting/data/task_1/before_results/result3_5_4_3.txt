To solve the equation presented in the uploaded image, we first need to correctly read it. The equation is a summation:
x=1
∑
10
(−3x
2
−x)
This is a sum of terms of the form 
−3x
2
−x for 
x ranging from 1 to 10.
To solve this, we will calculate the sum of each term where 
x takes on each integer value from 1 to 10. Let's compute this using Python.
The answer is -1210.
