The OCR output is not perfect due to the complexity of the mathematical notation. However, from the OCR output and the initial image provided, it appears the equation is related to a summation involving trigonometric functions. The equation seems to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine of a fraction that involves 
π, and an expression with 
x.
To proceed accurately, I will now manually transcribe the equation based on the images provided and then solve it. Let's start by transcribing the equation:
The equation looks like a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine function applied to:
2sin(
2
−πcos(
2
(−6)
x
π
)
)
π(70x+49)
I will now calculate this sum. 
The answer to the summation of the given trigonometric expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is approximately 
−6443.41.
