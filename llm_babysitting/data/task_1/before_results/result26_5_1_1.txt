The text extracted from the original image is not clear and contains errors. I will attempt to correct the expression by interpreting the common patterns of mathematical expressions and cross-referencing it with the lattice image for precise location information.
Let's proceed with a visual comparison to interpret and correct the expression. I'll start by examining specific sections of the lattice image to piece together the correct mathematical expression. 
Upon visual comparison of the original image and the lattice image, I can see the correct mathematical expression. It is a summation expression, running from 
x=1 to 
10, of 
x plus the fourth power of the sine of 
π
2
πx
.
The correct expression is:
∑
x=1
10
(x+sin
4
(
2
πx
))
Now, I will calculate the value of this expression. 
The answer is exactly 60.00.
