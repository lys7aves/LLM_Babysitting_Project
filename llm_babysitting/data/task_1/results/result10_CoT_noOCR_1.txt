To solve the mathematical expression given in the image, let's first transcribe the expression and then proceed with the calculation step by step.
The expression appears to be:
2
πsin(
π
7cos(
2
πx
)
)
∑
x=1
10
cos(3πx)
We will break this down into two parts: the numerator and the denominator.
Numerator: The sum of the cosine of multiples of 
3π from 
x=1 to 
x=10. Since the cosine function has a period of 
2π, 
cos(3πx) will repeat its values every two integers of 
x, and since 
3π is an odd multiple of 
π, 
cos(3πx) will be 
1 for even 
x and 
−1 for odd 
x.
Denominator: We have 
πsin(
π
7cos(
2
πx
)
)/2, which simplifies to 
sin(7cos(
2
πx
))/2. This expression depends on the value of 
x, but without a specific value of 
x, we can't simplify this further.
Given the complexity and periodic nature of the functions involved, we will calculate the numerator and check the form of the denominator to see if it simplifies across the range of 
x values. Let's start with calculating the numerator using Python.
The numerator, which is the sum of 
cos(3πx) from 
x=1 to 
x=10, results in 
0.0.
Since the numerator is 
0, the entire fraction will be 
0 regardless of the denominator's value (provided the denominator is not zero, which we can't determine without evaluating it for every 
x from 
1 to 
10).
The answer is 
0.
