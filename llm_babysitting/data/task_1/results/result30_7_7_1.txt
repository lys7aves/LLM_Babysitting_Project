To solve the mathematical expression given in the images, I'll start by comparing the two images to read the expression correctly, taking into account their relative positions and sizes.
The expression is a summation, with the variable 
x running from 1 to 10. The function to be summed over 
x is given by 
x
2
 minus the sine of another expression. The sine function's argument is the product of 
−
2
5
 and the sine of 
π
2
πx
, then multiplied by 
π.
The expression can be written as follows:
x=1
∑
10
(x
2
−sin((−
2
5
)sin(
2
πx
))π)
Now, let's calculate this expression using Python.
The answer is approximately 
386.88.
