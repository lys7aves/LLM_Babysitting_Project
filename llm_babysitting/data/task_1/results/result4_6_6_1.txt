The images you've uploaded seem to show a mathematical expression with a summation symbol. Let's start by accurately reading the expression from the images.
The expression appears to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine of the cosine of a function of 
x. However, it's important to precisely determine the function inside the cosine to ensure accurate calculation.
The expression inside the cosine seems to be 
π(x+
2x
5
1
).
The overall expression can be written as:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2x
5
1
))
)
Now that we have the expression, we can proceed to calculate it. I'll use Python to perform the summation and provide the result. Let's move on to the calculation.
The answer is approximately 
1.
