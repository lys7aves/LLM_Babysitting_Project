The mathematical expression depicted in the images is a summation, which can be read as follows:
∑
x=1
10
sin
x
(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
This expression indicates a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the 
x-th power of the sine of the fraction 
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
.
To calculate the expression, we'll need to compute the value of the sine function raised to the power of 
x for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then sum those values together.
Let's calculate this step by step using Python.
The answer is 5.0.
