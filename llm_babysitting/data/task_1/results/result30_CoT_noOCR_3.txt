Let's start by calculating the expression given in the uploaded image, step by step.
The expression is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
(x
2
−sin((−
2
5
)sin(
2
πx
)π))
To calculate this, we need to evaluate the expression within the summation for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then sum the results. The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and since it is multiplied by 
−
2
5
π, the second term will also oscillate.
I will now calculate the sum using Python.
The answer is 386.
