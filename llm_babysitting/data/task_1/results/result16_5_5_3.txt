To calculate the expression shown in the images, we will need to evaluate the following summation:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
Given the pattern of the sine function, especially with its argument being multiplied by 
2
π
, we can expect some repetition in the values due to the periodic nature of the sine function. Let's proceed with the calculation step by step.
The answer is 5.
