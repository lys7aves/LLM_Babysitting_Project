The images you've uploaded contain a mathematical expression, and you've indicated that the second image has a lattice overlaid to assist with precise location information for the elements of the expression. Without using Python to read the images, I will rely on the description you provided to understand and compute the expression manually.
The expression within the sum appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
sin
⎝
⎛
2sin(
2
πcos((
π
−6
)
x
π)
)
π(70x+49)
⎠
⎞
To evaluate this, I will follow these steps:
Calculate the innermost expression 
(
π
−6
)
x
π.
Compute the cosine of this expression.
Determine the sine of 
π
2
π
 times the cosine from step 2.
Calculate 
70x+49 and then multiply it by 
π.
Divide the result from step 4 by 2 times the result from step 3.
Take the sine of the result from step 5.
Repeat steps 1-6 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
Sum the sine values obtained for each 
x.
I will now proceed to calculate the final answer using Python.
The answer is approximately -0.5113.
