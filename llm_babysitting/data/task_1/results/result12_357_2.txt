Let's begin by examining the original expression to understand its structure. The expression is a sum, indicated by the summation symbol 
Σ, with an index variable 
x that runs from 1 to 10. Each term in the sum is given by the expression 
(−7)
x
−9.
Now that we have the correct form of the expression, we can proceed to calculate it using Python. We will evaluate the sum for each value of 
x from 1 to 10 and add the results to get the final answer. Let's do this calculation.
The answer is 
247,165,752.
