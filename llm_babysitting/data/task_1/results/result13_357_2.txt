ChatGPT
The expressions given in the images are mathematical sums. Since I cannot view the images directly, I will rely on your description to understand the expression.
You've indicated that all images represent the same expression, and it appears to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of a function that involves 
(−1)
x
, 
cos(
2
πx
), and the number 10. The exact expression, based on your description, seems to be:
∑
x=1
10
−8(−1)
x
(cos(
2
πx
)+10)
To proceed with calculating this sum, I will evaluate each term in the series from 
x=1 to 
x=10 and add them together. The cosine function has a periodic behavior with 
π, so 
cos(
2
πx
) will take on values of 1, 0, or -1 depending on the value of 
x. Let's calculate this sum.
The answer is 
8.
