All right, we have an expression in the form of an image which we need to calculate. I'll analyze the image and then we can calculate the expression step by step.
The expression is a complex fraction with a sum in the numerator and a product in the denominator.
The numerator of the large fraction is:
πsin
⎝
⎛
2
πcos(
2
π
+
2
sin(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
+
2
81
The denominator is just:
2
Before we perform the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10, let's simplify the inner part of the expression first.
The innermost part to look at is:
2
πcos(
2
π
+
2
sin(
2
πx
)
)
The function 
cos(
2
π
+θ) is equivalent to 
−sin(θ) due to the co-function identity for sine and cosine (cosine is the sine of the complementary angle).
We can thus rewrite the innermost part as:
−
2
πsin(
2
sin(
2
πx
)
)
Next, we need to evaluate this expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, sum the results, and divide by 2 to get the final answer.
Let's start by simplifying the expression for a general 
x and then we will perform the summation using Python.
The answer is approximately 
201.426.
