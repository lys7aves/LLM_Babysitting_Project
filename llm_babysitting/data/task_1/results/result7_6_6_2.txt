The two images you've uploaded appear to depict a mathematical expression involving a summation. The expression is 
∑
x=1
10
−9x
−3
.
To compare the images, we should note the following:
The first image shows the expression in its standard form.
The second image overlays a 6x6 grid on top of the expression, presumably to aid in precisely locating the elements of the expression.
The grid does not seem to alter the expression itself, but it's important to accurately interpret the expression when characters have superscripts or subscripts, which can be critical in mathematical notation. In this case, the exponent "-3" is clearly a superscript on the "x," indicating that x is to be raised to the power of -3.
With the expression understood, we can proceed to calculate the value of the sum:
The expression is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
−9x
−3
, which simplifies to 
−9×
x
3
1
.
To find the value of this sum, I will calculate each term from 
x=1 to 
x=10 and then sum these values. Let's do this calculation.
The answer is approximately -10.7778.
