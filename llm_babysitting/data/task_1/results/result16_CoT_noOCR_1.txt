This mathematical expression represents a sum of cosine functions evaluated at certain points determined by the formula inside the cosine function. To calculate the sum, we need to evaluate the cosine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, where 
x is substituted into the formula inside the cosine.
The expression inside the sum is:
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
We will evaluate this for 
x=1,2,…,10 and then sum the results. I will now calculate the value using Python.
The answer is 5.
