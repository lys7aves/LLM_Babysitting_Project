To calculate the expression depicted in the image, we should interpret the mathematical symbols and perform the calculation step by step. Let's break down the expression:
The large brackets encompass the entire expression, indicating that we have a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are themselves composed of sums or products of trigonometric functions.
In the numerator, we have a sum of two terms:
The first term is the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
sin(x).
The second term is 
4πsin.
The denominator consists of two terms divided by each other:
The first term is 
πsin which is being divided by a second term.
The second term is another fraction, wh
