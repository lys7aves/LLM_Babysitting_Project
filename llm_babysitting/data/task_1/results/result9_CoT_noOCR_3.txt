To calculate the expression from the image, which is a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of 
sin(π(x+
2
3
)), we need to recognize a property of the sine function. The sine function has a period of 
2π, which means that it repeats its values every 
2π radians. Moreover, 
sin(πx) is zero for every integer value of 
x.
In this particular sum, we're evaluating the sine of a multiple of 
π for each term, which will result in each term of the sum being zero, because 
sin(nπ)=0 for any integer 
n. So without needing to evaluate each term individually, we can say that the sum of these terms will be zero.
Therefore, the answer is 
0.
