To solve the given expression, I'll first visually inspect the images to understand the mathematical expression they represent. Then, I'll proceed to calculate the value of the expression using Python.
The mathematical expression to be evaluated is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
(10+x−2x
2
)
This is a finite series where 
x takes on the integer values from 1 to 10. Each term of the series is given by the expression 
(10+x−2x
2
).
Now, let's calculate the sum of this series.
The answer is 
−615.
