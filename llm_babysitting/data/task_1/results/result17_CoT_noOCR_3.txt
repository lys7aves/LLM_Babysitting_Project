The expression you've provided appears to be a summation involving trigonometric functions. The summation is from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of a function that itself involves the sine function.
The expression inside the summation is:
cos(
2
sin(πx)
)
To calculate this, we'll need to evaluate the cosine of the sine of each integer multiple of 
π from 1 to 10, divide by 2, and then sum these results.
Let's proceed with these calculations.
The answer is exactly 10.0.
