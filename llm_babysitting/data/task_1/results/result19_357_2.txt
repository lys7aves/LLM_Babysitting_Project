The images you've uploaded appear to be different representations of a mathematical expression, overlaid with a lattice grid. The purpose of these grids is to give an accurate representation of the placement and size of the components of the expression.
I will start by interpreting the expression from the original image without the lattice, as the additional lattice images are there to assist in determining the precise location and size of the components.
Once I have interpreted the expression, I will use Python to calculate the value of the expression. Let's begin by analyzing the original image to read the mathematical expression correctly.
Upon inspecting the original image, the mathematical expression provided appears to be a summation. Here's the interpretation of the expression:
x=1
∑
10
(
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
)
x
This is the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the function 
(
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
)
x
.
Now, let's calculate the sum using Python.
The answer is approximately 
915154256423.4293.
