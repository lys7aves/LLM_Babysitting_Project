ChatGPT
I understand that you've provided images of a mathematical expression on different lattices to assist in accurately reading the expression. I cannot view these images directly. However, based on your description, it seems you are asking to read and calculate the following expression:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
))
To calculate this expression, we need to consider each term in the sum for 
x ranging from 1 to 10. This will involve evaluating the cosine function for each 
x, scaling and translating it, then taking the sine of the resulting value.
Let's proceed to calculate this expression using Python.
The answer is 
−5.
