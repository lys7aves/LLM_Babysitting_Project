Let's go through the expression step by step.
The expression is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is a product of 
3πx and the cosine of a complex expression involving 
x. The denominator is simply 
2.
The complex expression in the cosine function is itself the sum of two parts:
The sine of 
π
2
π
, which is 
1, multiplied by 
π, giving us 
π.
A fraction where the numerator is 
−cos(
2
πx
) times 
π and the denominator is 
π. The 
π in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving 
−cos(
2
πx
).
Thus, the full expression inside the cosine is 
π−cos(
2
πx
).
We can calculate this sum by iterating through the values of 
x from 
1 to 
10 and evaluating the expression for each 
x. Let's perform this calculation using Python.
The answer is approximately 
−194.19.
