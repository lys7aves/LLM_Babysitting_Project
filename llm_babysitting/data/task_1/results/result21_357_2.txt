To solve the mathematical expression, I'll begin by interpreting the original expression from the images provided. The use of lattice grids in the additional images is to help identify the precise location of elements in the expression, ensuring that we accurately interpret superscripts, subscripts, and other mathematical notation.
From the first image, I can see that it's a summation expression. The summation symbol is large and extends from 
x=1 to 
10, indicating that we are summing over the variable 
x from 1 to 10. Inside the summation, there is a cosine function. The argument of the cosine function is a fraction. The numerator of the fraction contains another function, sine, whose argument is 
π times another fraction. This inner fraction has 
x in the numerator and 
2 in the denominator, added to 
3
2
3
. The denominator of the main fraction is simply 
2.
Therefore, the expression to evaluate is:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
Now, I will calculate the value of this expression using Python.
The answer is exactly 5.0.
