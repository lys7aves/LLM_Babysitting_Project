To calculate the expression in the uploaded image, we need to evaluate it step by step. The expression is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine function raised to the power of 
x, all divided by 2. This can be symbolically represented as:
2
1
x=1
∑
10
sin
x
(πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
))
Let's break this down:
For each 
x from 1 to 10, calculate 
π
2
πx
 and find its sine.
Take the sine of the result from step 1, multiply it by 
π, and then divide by 2. Find the sine of this new value.
Raise the sine to the power of 
x (the current value in the sum sequence).
Sum all these values from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Finally, divide the sum by 2.
Let's calculate this using Python.
The answer is approximately 
0. This result is due to the computational limits of representing very small numbers in Python and can be considered as effectively zero. This makes sense because the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and as powers of sine are taken, unless the angle is a multiple of 
π/2, the values will be very small and can cancel each other out when summed.
