The result of the summation is not a numerical value but rather 'nan' which stands for 'not a number'. This typically indicates an indeterminate form or a division by zero somewhere in the summation process. Since the expression involves a sine function in the denominator, which can be zero for certain values of 
x, this might be the cause of the issue.
To further investigate, we could check the individual terms of the summation to see if any of them results in a division by zero. Let's do that. 
Each term in the summation results in 'nan', indicating that the issue is persistent across all terms from 1 to 10. This is likely due to the term 
sin((−6)
x
2
π
) in the denominator.
When 
x is even, 
(−6)
x
 is positive, and the expression inside the sine function is a multiple of 
π, which makes the sine zero and causes a division by zero. When 
x is odd, 
(−6)
x
 is negative, and the sine function can still potentially be zero if the expression inside is an odd multiple of 
π.
Hence, the expression is not properly defined for the values of 
x from 1 to 10 in the given summation, resulting in 'not a number' (nan) for each term. If you have any constraints or modifications for the expression that might have been missed, please provide them, and I can re-evaluate the summation.
