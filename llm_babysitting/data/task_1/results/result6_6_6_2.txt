To begin with, I will compare the two images based on their relative positions and sizes, looking at subscripts, superscripts, and overall structure to ensure that I have the correct mathematical expression.
From the images provided, the mathematical expression appears to be a summation that runs from 
x=1 to 
x=10, of the following formula:
(6x(sin(
2
πx
)+10)
4
8
−8)
Given that 
8
4
8
 simplifies to 2, the expression within the summation can be rewritten as:
(6x(sin(
2
πx
)+10)
2
−8)
Now that I have the correct expression, I will calculate its value using Python. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is 33670.0.
