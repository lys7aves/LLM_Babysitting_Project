To calculate the expression given in the image, let's break it down step by step.
The expression is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the following term:
2
cos(3πxcos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
π
7cos(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
)
We notice a nested trigonometric function, which we will need to simplify step by step.
Starting from the innermost function:
2
πx
 is an argument for the 
cos function.
The result of that 
cos function is then multiplied by 7 and divided by 
π, which simplifies to just 
7cos(
2
πx
).
This result is then used as the argument for the 
sin function.
The 
sin result is multiplied by 
π and then used as the argument for the 
cos function again.
Finally, this result is multiplied by 
3πx and taken as the argument for another 
cos function, which is then divided by 2 to give us the term we add in our sum.
Given the complexity of this expression, we can calculate the sum using Python. Let's do it step by step.
The answer is approximately 
−0.6315.
