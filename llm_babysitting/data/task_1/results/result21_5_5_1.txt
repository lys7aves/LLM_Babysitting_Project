It appears that the optical character recognition (OCR) did not detect any text in the image. This could be due to the complexity of the mathematical symbols in the equation, which OCR can sometimes struggle with. I will attempt another method to extract and interpret the equation from the image. Let's try enhancing the image and then applying OCR again. 
The enhanced image processing also did not yield a readable output from OCR. Since the equation is not being recognized by the OCR software, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the original image you have uploaded, and then calculate the result.
The expression in the image is a summation:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
Now I will calculate this expression. 
The answer is 5.
