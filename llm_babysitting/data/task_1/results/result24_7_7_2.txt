The expression in the images is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(cos(
2
πx
)+
2
7
))
We are to calculate the value of this expression. The expression involves a sum of sine functions, where the argument of the sine function is a function of 
π, the cosine of 
π
2
πx
, and a constant 
2
7
.
The summation runs from 
x=1 to 
x=10. We will calculate this using Python.
The answer is
