The two images represent a mathematical expression that involves a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of a function involving 
x, sine function, and some constants. The second image with the grid overlay is intended to help discern the precise layout of the mathematical terms, which is crucial for understanding superscripts, subscripts, and the overall structure of the expression.
The expression can be read as:
∑
x=1
10
(6x(sin(
2
πx
+10))
4
−8)
Now that we have the correct expression, we can proceed to calculate it using Python.
The answer is approximately 10.1176.
