The expression from the images can be interpreted as follows:
∑
x=1
10
(6x(sin(
2
πx
)+10)
8
4
−8)
This is a summation expression where 
x ranges from 1 to 10. Inside the summation, there is a multiplication of 6x with a sinusoidal function raised to the power of 4/8 (which simplifies to 1/2, or the square root), added to 10, and then the whole term is subtracted by 8.
To calculate this expression, I will:
Compute the sine function for each 
x value, multiplied by 
π over 2.
Add 10 to the result of the sine function and take the square root (since 
4
8
4
 simplifies to 
1
2
1
 which indicates a square root).
Multiply by 6x.
Subtract 8.
Sum all results from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's calculate this in Python.
The answer is approximately 967.71.
