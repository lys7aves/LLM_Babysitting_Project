First, I'll examine the provided mathematical expression using the original and the lattice-overlaid images to understand the structure of the formula and identify any superscripts, subscripts, or other notational elements accurately.
The expression appears to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of a fraction where the numerator is 
πxcos(
2
πx
) and the denominator is 
2. The summation appears to apply to the entire fraction, not just the numerator.
Thus, the mathematical expression is:
∑
x=1
10
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
Now, I will calculate the value of this expression using Python.
The answer is approximately 
−9.4248.
