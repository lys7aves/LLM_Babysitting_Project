To calculate the given summation expression, we follow the mathematical rules for summation (Σ) notation. The expression inside the summation is 
(−7)
x
−9, and we are summing over the integer values of 
x from 1 to 10. Let's calculate the sum.
The summation expression 
∑
x=1
10
((−7)
x
−9) can be calculated by evaluating the expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then adding up all the resulting values.
I'll perform the calculations for each 
x and then sum the results.
The answer is 247,165,752.
