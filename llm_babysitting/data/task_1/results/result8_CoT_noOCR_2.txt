The expression in the image is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
π(70x+49)
)
To compute this, we should evaluate the sine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and sum the results. Remember that the sine function is periodic with a period of 
2π, so we may encounter some simplifications due to this periodicity.
Let's calculate the sum.
The sum of the given expression evaluates to 0. Therefore, the answer is 
0.
