To calculate the given expression, we will evaluate the sum of the sine of a function of 
x:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(cos(
2
πx
)+
2
7
))
Let's calculate this step by step.
cos(
2
πx
) has a period of 4, so it will repeat its values for 
x=1,5,9; 
x=2,6,10; 
x=3,7; and 
x=4,8. The values of cosine for these 
x values are 
cos(π/2),cos(π),cos(3π/2), and 
cos(2π) respectively.
Adding 
7
2
7
 to these cosine values will shift them up by 
7
2
7
 units.
Taking the sine of 
π times the result will involve the periodic nature of the sine function as well. Since 
sin(πy) has a period of 1 for 
y, the sine function will repeat its values whenever the argument is an integer multiple of 
π.
Now, I'll calculate the sum using these observations.
The answer is 
0.
