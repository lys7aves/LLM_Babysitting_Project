To solve the mathematical expression given in the images, we should first interpret it correctly. The expression is a summation:
x=1
∑
10
(x
2
−sin(
2
−5sin(
2
πx
)
)π)
To calculate this expression, we need to evaluate the sum for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, calculate the square of 
x, then calculate the sine of 
π
2
πx
, multiply that by -5, divide by 2, take the sine of the result, multiply by 
π, and subtract from 
x
2
. Finally, we sum all these values.
Let's proceed to calculate this step by step using Python.
The answer is approximately 386.88.
