The first step is to accurately read the mathematical expression from the images provided.
Looking at the images, the expression is a summation that can be interpreted as:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
Now, let's proceed to calculate this expression. Since this involves a summation of the cosine of an expression where x varies from 1 to 10, we will calculate each term and then sum them up. Let's begin.
The answer is 
5.0.
