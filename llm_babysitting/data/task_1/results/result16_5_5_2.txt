The OCR process did not extract the mathematical expression from the images effectively. This could be due to the complexity of the mathematical notation or the quality of the images. To proceed with the calculation, I will analyze the images directly and attempt to interpret the mathematical expression manually.
Let's start by examining the original image to identify the expression. 
After examining the original image, the mathematical expression is as follows:
∑
x=1
10
cos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
We will now calculate this expression.
