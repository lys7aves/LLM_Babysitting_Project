The image you've uploaded contains a mathematical expression that represents a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of a cosine function, where the argument of the cosine is a fraction whose numerator is 
sin of 
2
πxsin(
2
5πx
)
.
To calculate this sum, we'll evaluate the cosine of the complex expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and add the results together. Let's begin the calculation step by step.
The sum of the given expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is 
10. Therefore, the answer is 
10.
