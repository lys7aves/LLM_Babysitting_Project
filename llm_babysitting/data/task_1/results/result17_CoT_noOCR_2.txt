Let's work through the calculation step by step.
The given expression is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of a fraction:
∑
x=1
10
cos
⎝
⎛
2
sin(
πx
πsin(
2
5πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
The innermost part of this expression is 
5
2
5πx
, which is an argument to the sine function. We can evaluate this for 
x from 1 to 10. Then, we multiply the result by 
π and divide by 
πx. However, since we multiply and then divide by 
πx, these will cancel out, leaving us with just 
sin(
2
5πx
).
Next, we take the sine of this result, and then we take the cosine of half of that.
Since cosine is an even function, meaning that 
cos(−θ)=cos(θ), we only need to calculate the sine values for 
5
2
5πx
 and determine whether they are positive or negative to know the value of the cosine after it is halved.
Let's calculate the values of 
sin(
2
5πx
) for 
x from 1 to 10, and then proceed with the sum.
The answer is approximately 9.388.
