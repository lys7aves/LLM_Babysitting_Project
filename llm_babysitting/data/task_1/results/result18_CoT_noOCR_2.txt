Let's start by analyzing the expression given in the image. It's a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of the cosine of the following expression:
cos(
2
πsin(
2
π
(x
3
−1))
)
To calculate this sum, we'll evaluate the inner expression for each integer value of 
x from 
1 to 
10, take the cosine of the result, and then sum all those cosine values together. I'll perform these steps using Python. Let's begin the calculation.
The answer is 5.0.
