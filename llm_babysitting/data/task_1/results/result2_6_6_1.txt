Given the provided images, which I understand cannot be displayed or directly read by the system, we can still proceed with the description you've given. The mathematical expression appears to be a summation, which can be written in LaTeX format as:
x=1
∑
10
(10+x−2x)
To calculate this, we can simplify the expression inside the summation before performing the sum:
x=1
∑
10
(10+x−2x)=
x=1
∑
10
(10−x)
Now, we will calculate the sum of 
10−x from 
x=1 to 
x=10:
x=1
∑
10
(10−x)=(10−1)+(10−2)+⋯+(10−10)
Let's compute this using Python.
The answer is 
45.
