The images you've uploaded seem to represent a mathematical expression, which is the summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of 
sin
x
(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
).
To calculate the expression, we'll evaluate the sum of the function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
I'll now calculate this sum using Python.
The answer is exactly 5.0.
