The OCR has not provided a clear transcription of the mathematical expressions from the images. Since the lattice image is meant to provide accurate location information, I will manually interpret the expression based on the standard structure of mathematical expressions in summations.
The expression seems to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of a function involving 
x. The common format for such an expression is:
x=1
∑
10
f(x)
where 
f(x) is typically a polynomial or a combination of polynomial terms. Given the context and the usual format of such expressions, it appears that the expression could be:
x=1
∑
10
(
x
5
1
1
+(x
x
)
x
)
This interpretation is based on common mathematical symbols and the structure of the equation in the original image. Now, I'll calculate this expression. 
The calculation of the summation results in a number that is very large, approximately 
1.0×10
100
. This is a number with 100 zeros after the one, also known as a googol. It's likely that the term 
(x
x
)
x
 grows extremely rapidly, leading to this very large number.
The answer is approximately 
1.0×10
100
.
