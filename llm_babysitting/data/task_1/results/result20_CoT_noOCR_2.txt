The uploaded image depicts a mathematical expression of a sum using sigma notation. The expression is the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
(x+1).
To calculate this, we can sum up the values of 
(x+1) for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:
S
n
=
2
n
(a
1
+a
n
)
where 
S
n
 is the sum of the first 
n terms of the arithmetic sequence, 
a
1
 is the first term, and 
a
n
 is the 
nth term.
Since 
(x+1) is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, we can calculate the sum as follows:
First term 
a
1
 when 
x=1: 
1+1=2
Last term 
a
10
 when 
x=10: 
10+1=11
Let's plug these values into the formula to find the sum.
The sum of the expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
(x+1) is 65.
The answer is 65.
