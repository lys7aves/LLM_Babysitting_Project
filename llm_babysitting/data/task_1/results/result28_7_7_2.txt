To solve the problem, I'll first manually compare the two images and read the expression accurately.
From the first image, the expression is a summation:
âˆ‘
x=1
10
(x
x
+9)
This means that we need to calculate the sum of 
x
x
+9 for each integer value of x from 1 to 10.
The second image is meant to provide a clearer view of the expression using a lattice, but since the images are not accessible with my tools, I will rely on the expression given in the first image to perform the calculation.
Now I'll calculate this expression using Python.
The answer is 
10405071407.
