It seems that the OCR process was not able to extract the text from the images. This could be due to the complexity of the mathematical notation or the quality of the images. I'll attempt a different approach by manually interpreting the mathematical expression from the images you've uploaded. Let's proceed with that. 
The equation depicted in the images is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
))
This is a summation expression, where 
x takes on integer values from 1 to 10. To calculate this, I will evaluate the sine function for each value of 
x within the given range and sum the results. Let's calculate this expression. 
The answer is 
−5.0.
