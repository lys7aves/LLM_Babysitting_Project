The expression shown in the images is a mathematical sum:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
To calculate the expression, we must evaluate the cosine term for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then sum these values.
I will now calculate the value of this expression using Python.
The answer is 
5.0.
