To solve the mathematical expression in the images, I will first accurately read the expression using the provided lattice images for precise positioning. Then, I'll proceed to calculate the expression using Python, if necessary.
Based on the original image and the additional images with the 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 lattice overlays, the expression is:
x=1
∑
10
(x
−
x
5
1
+(x
x
)
x
)
This is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of two terms. The first term is 
x to the power of 
−
x
5
1
, and the second term is 
x raised to the power of 
x, and that result raised to the power of 
x again.
Now I will calculate this expression using Python.
The sum of the expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is a very large number, approximately 
10
100
, which is known as a googol. This value is extremely large due to the second term 
(x
x
)
x
 which grows extremely rapidly. Thus, the answer is approximately 
10
100
.
