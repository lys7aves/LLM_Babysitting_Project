To accurately read the expression from the images, I'll look closely at the positioning and sizes of elements within the expression to determine the correct notation, especially for superscripts and subscripts. The lattices provided in the additional images will be used to judge the relative positions and ensure accuracy.
Once the expression is correctly identified, I'll use Python to calculate the final answer. Let's start by interpreting the expression.
Looking at the original image and considering the lattice overlays, we can deduce the following:
The large brackets encompass the entire expression, indicating that everything inside is grouped together.
The summation sign 
∑ with the lower limit 
x=1 and the upper limit 
10 indicates we are summing over the index 
x from 1 to 10.
The sine function 
sin follows the summation sign, with its argument seemingly to be determined.
The fraction line within the bracketed expression indicates division.
The numerator of the fraction within the brackets appears to contain another sine function 
sin, which in turn has a fraction as its argument.
The numerator of this inner fraction contains 
πcos, with its argument being another fraction.
The denominator of this inner fraction within the sine function is 
2.
The denominator of the main fraction is 
2.
With these observations, let's reconstruct the mathematical expression from the original image:
(
(
x=1
∑
10
sin(4πsin(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)))÷2
Now that the expression has been interpreted, I will proceed to calculate it using Python.
The answer is approximately 
0. The result is a very small number close to zero, which in the context of numerical calculations, can be considered as 
0 due to the limitations of floating-point precision.
