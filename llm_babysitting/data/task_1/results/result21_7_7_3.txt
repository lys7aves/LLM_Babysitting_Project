The two images you've uploaded appear to be the same mathematical expression. The second image with the lattice overlay is intended to provide precise location information to assist in the accurate reading of the mathematical expression. Based on the lattice, I can deduce the relative positions and sizes to check superscripts and subscripts.
The expression from the images can be interpreted as follows:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
π
(x+
2
3
))
)
This expression represents a sum of the cosine of half the product of π and the sine of (π/2) times (x + 3/2), with x ranging from 1 to 10.
To calculate the sum of this trigonometric expression, we can use Python. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is approximately 4.440158403262126.
