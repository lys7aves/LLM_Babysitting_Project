The two images you've uploaded are mathematical expressions. The first step is to interpret the expression accurately. Looking at the images, here's the mathematical expression I can discern:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2x
5
1
))
)
Given that the expression involves a summation of the sine of a complex argument involving 
π, cosines, and a series from 
x=1 to 
x=10, we can calculate this expression using Python.
I will now proceed to calculate the value of this expression.
The answer is approximately 
1.
