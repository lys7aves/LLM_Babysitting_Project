The OCR results for the original image appear to capture the mathematical expression correctly as 10 > (—3^2 + x) a=1, which seems to be a misinterpretation of the summation expression. The OCR for the lattice image did not produce a coherent result.
Given that OCR has failed to correctly interpret the text, particularly from the image with the lattice, I will proceed to manually compare the two images. Based on the original image, the expression should be read as:
∑
x=1
10
(−3x
2
+x)
Now, I will calculate this expression. 
The answer is 
−1100.
