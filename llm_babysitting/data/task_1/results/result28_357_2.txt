Let's start by examining the mathematical expression depicted in the images. It appears to be a summation notation, commonly used in mathematics to represent the sum of a sequence of terms. The lattice overlay in the additional images is meant to help us discern the precise layout and elements of the expression, such as superscripts or subscripts, which can be critical for correct interpretation.
The expression in the images is:
x=1
âˆ‘
10
(x
x
+9)
This tells us we are summing the sequence of 
x
x
+9 where 
x takes on the integer values from 1 to 10.
Now, let's calculate the sum. We will do this by calculating 
x
x
 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, adding 9 to each result, and then summing all those results together. Let's proceed with the calculation using Python.
The answer is 
10,405,071,407.
