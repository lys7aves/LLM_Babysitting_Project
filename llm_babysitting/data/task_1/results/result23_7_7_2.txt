Upon reviewing the two images you have uploaded, it appears that they both depict a mathematical summation expression. The lattice over the second image is intended to provide a precise guide to interpreting the components of the expression.
Based on the first image (which is clearer and without the lattice), the expression reads as follows:
∑
x=1
10
(
x
5
2
1
+(x
x
)
x
)
To calculate this expression, I will perform the summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the two terms within the summation. The first term is 
x
5
2
1
, which is the x-th root of 
x
2
 (or 
x to the power of 2/5). The second term is 
(x
x
)
x
, which is 
x raised to the power of 
x
2
.
Now let's calculate the value of this expression using Python.
The answer is approximately 
1.0×10
100
. This result indicates that the sum is a number with 1 followed by 100 zeros, which is extremely large due to the exponential term in the summation.
