The expression in the images is a summation that runs from 
x=1 to 
x=10, with the summand being 
sin
x
(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
).
To calculate this expression, we need to compute the sum of the sin function raised to the x-th power, where the argument of the sin function is 
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
, for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10. Let's perform this calculation step by step using Python.
The answer is exactly 5.0.
