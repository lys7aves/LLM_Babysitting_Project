The expression in the image you uploaded is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
sin
⎝
⎛
2
πcos(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
To calculate this expression, we need to evaluate the sine function for each value of 
x from 1 to 10, where 
x influences the argument of the sine function through nested cosine functions. Let's perform this calculation using Python.
The answer is 5.
