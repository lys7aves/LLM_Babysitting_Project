This expression involves irrational numbers, and each term is the sine of half the product of π and the cosine of a fraction multiplied by π, which makes the exact numerical evaluation quite complex without a computational tool. If you need a numerical approximation, I can compute that for you as well. Would you like to proceed with the numerical evaluation?
