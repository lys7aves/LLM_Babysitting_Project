Let's start by examining the mathematical expression in the original image provided. We will look at the notation and any subscripts or superscripts to ensure we understand the mathematical operation being represented.
Once we have a clear understanding of the expression, I will proceed to calculate the result using Python. Let's begin by interpreting the expression. I'll look at the images now and describe the mathematical expression.
Afterward, I will calculate the value of the expression.
The expression in the images appears to be a summation:
âˆ‘
x=1
10
(x+1)
This is a simple arithmetic series where we sum the numbers from 2 to 11 (which is each x from 1 to 10, incremented by 1). To calculate this sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
S=
2
n
(a
1
+a
n
)
where:
n is the number of terms,
a
1
 is the first term,
a
n
 is the last term.
For our series, 
n=10, 
a
1
=2, and 
a
n
=11. Now I'll calculate the sum using this formula.
The answer is 
65.
