To solve this problem, I'll need to carefully analyze the mathematical expression you've provided and then calculate its value. Let me take a closer look at the images and proceed with the calculation.
The text extracted from the images is not clear enough to determine the exact mathematical expression. Since OCR (Optical Character Recognition) has difficulties with mathematical notation, especially when it comes to complex formulas, I'll need to manually interpret the expression based on the lattice provided and the structure of the formula.
I will now analyze the lattice image and attempt to manually deduce the correct mathematical expression to calculate its value. 
The lattice image provides a clear structure of the mathematical expression, which appears to be a summation formula. From the pattern and usual mathematical conventions, the expression can be interpreted as:
x=1
∑
10
cos
x
(
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
)
This represents the sum of the cosine to the power of 
x of the given fraction, from 
x=1 to 
x=10. I will now calculate the value of this expression. 
The answer is 10.0.
