The mathematical expression from the images can be read as follows:
∑
x=1
10
(10x−50)sin(
2x
π
)
This is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the function 
(10x−50)sin(
2x
π
).
To calculate this expression, we will plug in each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 into the function and sum the results. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is approximately -47.38.
