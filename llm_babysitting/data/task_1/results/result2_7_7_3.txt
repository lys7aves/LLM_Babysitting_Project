The two images you've uploaded seem to contain a mathematical expression involving a summation. To begin, let's analyze the expression itself.
The expression is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the terms 
(10+x−2x). Simplifying the terms inside the parentheses gives us 
(10−x). This simplification is possible because 
x−2x=−x.
Now, the summation can be rewritten as:
∑
x=1
10
(10−x)
Next, let's calculate the sum. We can use Python to perform this calculation efficiently.
The answer is 45.
