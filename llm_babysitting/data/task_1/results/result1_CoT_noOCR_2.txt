To calculate the expression in the image, let's break it down step by step:
The expression can be described as follows:
(
2
(
9cos(
2
π
cos(
2
πx
+sin(
2
πx
)))
πsin(π)
+
2
81
)
We will sum this expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's start by simplifying the inner parts of the expression before performing the summation:
sin(π)=0 since the sine of pi is zero.
cos(
2
π
)=0 since the cosine of 
π
2
π
 is zero.
Given that cosine of zero is 1, the term 
9cos(0) simplifies to 9.
With these simplifications, the fraction inside the summation simplifies greatly because the term involving sine and cosine in the numerator will become zero due to multiplication by 
sin(π).
This leaves us with:
(
2
(0+
2
81
)
This simplifies to 
81
4
81
. Since this term does not depend on 
x, the summation of 10 identical terms will just be 10 times the term. Thus, the final answer  is:
10×
4
81
=
4
810
Now let's calculate the final answer.
The answer is 202.5.
