To calculate the given expression, we have a summation of the sine function, from 
x=1 to 
x=10, of 
π(x+
2
3
).
The sine function has a period of 
2π, meaning that 
sin(θ)=sin(θ+2πk) for any integer 
k. In this expression, however, we're adding multiples of 
π to the argument of the sine function, which will result in either 0, 1, or -1, because 
sin(nπ)=0 for any integer 
n, and 
sin(π/2+nπ)=(−1)
n
 for any integer 
n.
Let's calculate the value for each 
x from 1 to 10:
For odd 
x (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), 
x+
2
3
 is an integer plus 
1
2
1
, so the sine of 
π times this will be 1 or -1.
For even 
x (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), 
x+
2
3
 is an integer plus 
1
2
1
, so the sine of 
π times this will also be 1 or -1.
Because the sine function alternates between 1 and -1 for each successive integer multiple of 
π/2, the summation will effectively add and subtract these values in sequence.
Let's perform these calculations using Python.
The summation of the given expression evaluates to 0. Therefore, the answer is 
0.
