The original expression to interpret is a mathematical sum notation:
âˆ‘
x=1
10
(x
x
+9)
This notation indicates the sum of the expression 
x
x
+9 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
To calculate this expression, we will iterate through the values of 
x from 1 to 10, compute 
x
x
+9 for each, and then sum all of those computed values together. Let's go ahead and calculate that using Python.
The answer is 
10405071407.
