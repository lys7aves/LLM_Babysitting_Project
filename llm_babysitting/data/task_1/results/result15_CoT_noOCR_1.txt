The expression in the image you uploaded is a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of the function 
sin(
2
π
cos(π(x+
2
5
))).
To compute this, we'll evaluate the function for each integer value of 
x from 
1 to 
10, and then sum up all the resulting values. Let's calculate this step by step using Python.
The calculated sum of the expression is approximately 
−2.14×10
−14
. Since this is a very small number close to zero, we can conclude that the expression is essentially zero within numerical precision.
The answer is approximately 
0.
