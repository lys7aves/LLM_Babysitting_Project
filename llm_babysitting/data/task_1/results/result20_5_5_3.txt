The OCR process did not successfully extract readable text from the image. This often happens with images that contain mathematical expressions or non-standard fonts, as OCR software is typically optimized for plain text.
I will visually inspect the image and read the expression correctly before proceeding with the calculation.
After inspecting the image, the expression is:
x=1
∑
10
(x±1)
Now, I'll perform the calculation for this expression. The 
± symbol means that we could have either addition or subtraction. Since it's ambiguous, I'll perform the calculation with both 
+ and 
− to show both potential results. Let's calculate it step by step. 
The sum of the expression 
∑
x=1
10
(x+1) is 65, and the sum of the expression 
∑
x=1
10
(x−1) is 45.
Therefore, depending on whether the operation within the summation is addition or subtraction, the answer is:
For addition: The answer is 65.
For subtraction: The answer is 45.
