To solve the expression given in the image, we will first need to evaluate the mathematical formula presented. The formula is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of half the product of 
π and the sine of 
π times 
2
x
+
2
3
.
The expression is:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
π
sin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
)))
To calculate this, we need to perform the following steps for each value of 
x from 1 to 10:
Calculate 
2
x
+

.
Multiply this result by 
π.
Take the sine of this result.
Multiply the sine by 
2
π
.
Take the cosine of this result.
Finally, we sum up the results of the cosine for each value of 
x. Let's perform these calculations step by step using Python.
