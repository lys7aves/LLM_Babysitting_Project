The mathematical expression in the images provided is a sum given by the sigma notation, which reads:
x=1
∑
10
((−7)
x
−9)
This expression means we need to calculate the value of 
(−7)
x
−9 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and then sum all these values.
Now, let's calculate the expression step by step using Python.
The answer is 247,165,752.
