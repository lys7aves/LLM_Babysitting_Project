Let's begin by carefully examining the two images to ensure that we accurately interpret the equation they represent.
Once we have confirmed the equation, we will proceed to solve it.
I will start by analyzing the images to read the equation. Please hold on while I do this.
The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) results from the images are not providing a clear reading of the equation. Since the OCR is not accurate, I will manually inspect the images to interpret the equation correctly.
After manually inspecting the uploaded images, I will attempt to solve the equation. Please hold on while I interpret the equation from the images. 
Upon examining the images, the equation is:
∑
x=1
