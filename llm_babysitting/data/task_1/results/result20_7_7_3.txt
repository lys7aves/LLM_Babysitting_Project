To accurately compare the two images and understand the mathematical expression they represent, I will carefully consider the position of each character within the lattice in the second image. This will help me to confirm the correct indices and the overall structure of the expression. After this, I will proceed to calculate the value of the expression.
Let's start by examining the expression based on the lattice. The expression seems to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the quantity 
(x+1). The lattice helps ensure that the limits of the summation and the terms within the summation are correctly interpreted, particularly for distinguishing between superscripts, subscripts, and regular-sized numbers.
Given this interpretation, we can express the sum mathematically as:
x=1
∑
10
(x+1)
Now, let's calculate the sum using Python.
The sum of the sequence 
∑
x=1
10
(x+1) is 65.
Therefore, the answer is 65.
