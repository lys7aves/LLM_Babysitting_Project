Let's start by comparing the two images to ensure that the mathematical expression is understood correctly.
Upon inspection, both images depict the same mathematical expression, which is a summation expression. Using the lattice as a guide, we can confirm the positioning of the numbers and variables within the expression. The lattice does not affect the content of the expression; it merely provides a clear grid for reference.
The expression is as follows:
x=1
∑
10
(10+x−2x)
Now, let's simplify the expression inside the summation:
10
10+x−2x=10−x
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
x=1
∑
10
(10−x)
To calculate this, we need to evaluate the expression 
10−x for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and then sum those values. We can perform this calculation using Python. Let's proceed to calculate the final answer.
The answer is 45.
