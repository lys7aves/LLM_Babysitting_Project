To calculate the expression shown in the image, we can follow these steps:
Recognize that the expression is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine function applied to some more complex trigonometric expression.
The complex expression inside the sine function involves a fraction with a polynomial in the numerator and a constant in the denominator.
The polynomial in the numerator is 
π(70x+49).
The denominator is just 2.
Within the sine function, there's another trigonometric function, the cosine function, which itself has an exponentiation with base 
π and an exponent that depends on 
x as 
2
(−
π
6
)
x
π
.
Let's compute this step by step using Python, starting by calculating the innermost part for each value of 
x from 1 to 10, then applying the sine function, and finally summing all the terms together.
The answer is approximately 
−0.0359.
