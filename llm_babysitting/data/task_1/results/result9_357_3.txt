To solve the expression given in the images, we'll need to first accurately interpret the mathematical expression from the original image and then use the lattice-based images to confirm the precise placement of the variables and constants within the expression. This ensures that we correctly identify subscripts, superscripts, and other mathematical notation.
Given the expression:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
We will calculate the sum of the sine function, evaluated at multiples of π, starting from 
x+
2
3
 for x ranging from 1 to 10.
Let's calculate this using Python.
The sum of the given expression evaluates to 0. This is because the sine of any integer multiple of π is 0, and since 
x+
2
3
 where x is an integer will always result in an odd multiple of 
π
2
π
, the sine of these values will also be 0.
Therefore, the answer is 0.
