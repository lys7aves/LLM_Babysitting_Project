The expression in the image you've uploaded is a mathematical sum, specifically:
x=1
∑
10
(cosx)
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
This is a summation of ten terms where each term is the cosine of an integer x raised to the power of 
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
. To calculate this, we'll evaluate each term individually and then sum them together. Since the cosine function has a periodicity of 
2π, and the inner cosine function in the exponent has a frequency multiplier of 
π
2
π
, it will oscillate between 1 and -1 for even and odd values of 
x, respectively, due to the nature of the cosine function at multiples of 
π.
Let's start calculating this step by step using Python.
The calculation results in a nan (not a number), which suggests that there is an issue with the computation. This usually happens when an undefined operation occurs, such as taking a non-integer power of a negative number.
Given the nature of the cosine function, especially the inner cosine with its argument being 
π
2
πx
, the function will evaluate to 0 for all even values of 
x (because cosine of 
π, 
2π, 
3π, and so on is 0). Therefore, raising any number to the power of 0 gives us 1, but for odd values of 
x, where the cosine function evaluates to 
±1, the expression might be attempting to compute a complex number (since cosine of 
π
2
π
, 
3
2
3π
, etc., is 0, and raising a negative number to a non-integer power can result in a complex number).
To handle this, we should check the value of the inner cosine before raising it to the power. If the inner cosine is zero, the term contributes 1 to the sum. If the inner cosine is negative and the exponent is non-integer, the term is undefined for real numbers.
Let's adjust the code to handle these cases and try again. 
The calculation is still resulting in a nan, indicating that there are terms in the summation which lead to an undefined result within the real number system.
The issue likely lies with the exponentiation when the base is negative and the exponent is not an integer. In the real number system, raising a negative number to a non-integer power is undefined because it results in a complex number.
To correctly handle this, we should explicitly test whether the base (the cosine of 
x) is negative, and if so, check if the exponent is an integer. If the exponent is not an integer, we cannot include this term in the summation as it's outside the domain of real numbers. However, if the exponent is an integer, we can safely calculate the term, as an integer power of a negative number is defined in the real number system.
Let's implement these checks and attempt the calculation again. 
The calculation using symbolic computation gives us a complex number as the result. The real part of the sum is approximately 1.896, and the imaginary part is approximately 19.311. Since we are typically interested in real numbers when dealing with such expressions, the real part of the answer is approximately 
1.896.
The answer is approximately 
1.896.
