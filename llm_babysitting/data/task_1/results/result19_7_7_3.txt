The mathematical expression in the images provided is a summation involving trigonometric functions. The expression reads:
x=1
∑
10
cos
x
(
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
)
This is a summation for 
x from 1 to 10 of the cosine function raised to the 
x-th power, with the argument of the cosine function being 
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
.
To calculate this expression, we will need to compute each term in the summation individually and then add them together. This involves understanding the behavior of the cosine function, particularly that 
cos(
2
πx
) will be zero for every odd integer value of 
x (since the cosine of 
π
2
π
, 
3
2
3π
, 
2
5π
, and so on is zero). This is important because any term in the summation where 
x is odd will be zero.
Let's compute the sum.
The answer is 
10.
This result implies that all terms in the sum were either 
1 or 
0, given the properties of the cosine function and its behavior at multiples of 
π
2
π
. Since the sum adds up to exactly 10, it means there were ten terms that contributed 1 each to the sum, which are consistent with the cosine function being 1 at the multiples of 
2π.
