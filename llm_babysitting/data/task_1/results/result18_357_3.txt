Given the images and the task at hand, the first step is to interpret the mathematical expression accurately. Based on the descriptions provided for each image, we have:
The expression from the original image is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of a function of 
x. The function inside the cosine is 
2
πsin(π(
2
x
3
−1))
.
Now, let's calculate the value of this expression step by step for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and sum the results. I'll proceed with the calculation in Python.
The answer is exactly 
5.0.
