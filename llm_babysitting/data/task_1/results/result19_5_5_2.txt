I will first need to analyze the mathematical expression in the images provided. Once I understand the expression, I can proceed to calculate the value. Let's start by examining the original mathematical expression.
The text extracted from the images is not clear enough for a direct interpretation due to the complexity of mathematical expressions, which OCR software often struggles to interpret correctly. Therefore, I will manually interpret the mathematical content of the images to provide an accurate calculation. Let's proceed with that. 
I have displayed the images again for manual inspection. After reviewing the mathematical expression visually, it appears to be a summation from 1 to 10 of the cosine function raised to the power of x. Within the cosine function, there seems to be a product of πx and another cosine function, where the argument of the second cosine function is 
2
πx
.
The interpreted expression from the images looks like this:
∑
x=1
10
cos
x
(πxcos(
2
πx
))
I will now proceed to calculate this expression. 
The answer is 10.
