To calculate the given expression, we have the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine of 
π(cos(
2
πx
)+
2
7
).
The 
cos function has a period of 
2π, and since we are looking at 
cos(
2
πx
), it will have a period of 4 in terms of 
x. This means that for 
x=1,5,9, the cosine function will give the same value; for 
x=2,6,10, it will give the same value, and so on.
We should also note that the sine function has a period of 
2π. So any integral multiple of 
2π added to the argument of the sine function does not change its value.
Let's evaluate the cosine for the first four integer values of 
x to understand the pattern:
cos(
2
π
) which is 0.
cos(π) which is -1.
cos(
2
3π
) which is 0.
cos(2π) which is 1.
Now, we can calculate the value of the entire expression for each 
x from 1 to 10, and sum those values up. Let's do this calculation.
The answer is 
0.
