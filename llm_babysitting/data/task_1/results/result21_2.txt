The expression evaluates to 
3cos(
2
2
π
)+cos(πsin(0.75π))+cos(πsin(1.75π))+1.
However, the result contains trigonometric functions of trigonometric functions, which can often be simplified further. Let's see if we can simplify this result. 
The expression remains the same after simplification, so the final result is:
3cos(
2
2
π
)+cos(πsin(0.75π))+cos(πsin(1.75π))+1
This result is already in its simplest form as far as symbolic computation is concerned. If you need a numerical approximation, let me know and I can calculate that for you.
