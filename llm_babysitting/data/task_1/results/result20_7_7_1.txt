To compare the two images and calculate the expression, I'll proceed as follows:
First, I'll interpret the mathematical expression shown in both images.
Then, using the lattice as a reference, I'll ensure the correct understanding of the expression's components, such as indices and variables.
Finally, I'll calculate the value of the expression.
The mathematical expression depicted is a summation:
âˆ‘
x=1
10
(x+1)
This expression is asking us to sum the series where each term is 
x+1 and 
x goes from 1 to 10.
Now, let's calculate this using Python.
The answer is 65.
