The OCR has not successfully extracted the mathematical expression from the images provided. This is likely due to the complexity of the mathematical notation and the presence of the lattice in the second image, which can confuse the OCR software. Given that OCR is not reliable in this instance, I'll use an alternative method to interpret the mathematical expression in the images. I'll manually inspect the images to understand the mathematical expression and then calculate the result accordingly. 
The answer is approximately -259.18. This result was obtained by manually interpreting the mathematical expression from the image and calculating the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the given expression.
