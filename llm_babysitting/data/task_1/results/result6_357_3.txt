ChatGPT
I see that you have uploaded several images, which seem to depict the same mathematical expression with different grid overlays. Since I'm unable to directly view these images, I will rely on your description of the expression:
x=1
∑
10
(6x(sin(
2
πx
)+10)
4
−8)
To calculate this expression, I will perform the following steps:
Iterate 
x from 1 to 10.
For each 
x, calculate the value of the sine function 
sin(
2
πx
).
Add 10 to the result of the sine function, raise this sum to the power of 4.
Multiply this result by 
6x.
Subtract 8 from this result.
Sum all the results from each iteration.
Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is 3,511,270.
