To calculate the expression given in the uploaded image, we'll follow the steps outlined in the summation. The expression is:
x=1
∑
10
−8(−1)
x
(cos(
2
πx
)+10)
This is a finite summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 where each term involves an alternating factor of 
−1 raised to the power of 
x, a cosine function with argument 
π
2
πx
, and an addition of 10 inside the parentheses, all multiplied by -8.
The cosine function has a period of 
2π, so for 
cos(
2
πx
) the values will repeat every four terms. Specifically, the cosine of multiples of 
π and 
2
π
 can be either 0, 1, or -1. Since we're dealing with 
π
2
πx
, the value of the cosine function will be 0 when 
x is odd, and ±1 when 
x is even (positive when 
x is a multiple of 4, negative when 
x is even but not a multiple of 4).
Let's calculate the sum using Python.
The answer is 8.
