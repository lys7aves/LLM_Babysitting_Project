The expression depicted in the uploaded images is a mathematical summation:
∑
x=1
10
−9x
−3
This expression tells us to sum the values of 
−9x
−3
 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10. The 
x
−3
 indicates that 
x is raised to the power of -3, which is the same as dividing 1 by 
x
3
.
To calculate this expression, we need to compute each term individually where 
x ranges from 1 to 10, and then sum all these terms together. Let's do this calculation.
The answer is approximately -10.7778.
