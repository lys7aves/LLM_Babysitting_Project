To solve the given mathematical expression, I will first interpret it based on the lattice information provided. I'll then proceed to calculate the result.
From the lattice, we can discern the following mathematical expression:
∑
x=1
10
(x+sin
4
(
2
πx
))
Now let's calculate this expression step by step using Python. We will sum the series from 
x=1 to 
x=10, adding 
x to the fourth power of the sine of 
π
2
πx
 for each 
x.
The answer is 
60.0.
