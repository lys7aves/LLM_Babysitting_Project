It appears that the expression evaluates to an undefined result (nan), which suggests that there might be a division by zero or an indeterminate form somewhere within the summation. This is likely due to the sine function in the denominator being zero for some value of 
x.
To better understand why the expression yields an undefined result, let's analyze the term inside the sine function in the denominator:
sin(πcos((−
2
6
)
x
π))
If 
cos((−
2
6
)
x
π) is an integer multiple of 
π, then 
sin(πk) for any integer 
k is zero, which would cause the division by zero in the original expression. This can happen for specific values of 
x where 
(−
2
6
)
x
 is an integer.
The answer is undefined due to this reason.
