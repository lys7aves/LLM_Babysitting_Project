The given images are variations of the same mathematical expression with different lattice overlays meant to help identify the precise locations and sizes of the components of the expression. Based on the original and the overlaid images, I will first identify the correct mathematical expression.
The expression appears to be a summation, which starts with an index of 
x=1 and ends at 
10, of the cosine of a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is 
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
)), and the denominator is 
2.
The correct reading of the expression is:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
Now that the expression is identified correctly, I will calculate this expression using Python.
The answer is 
5.0.
