The OCR has not returned any recognizable text from the image. Let's try to process the image with a grid to see if that helps with the text recognition. I will now perform OCR on the image with the lattice grid. 
The OCR process has failed to extract text from both images. This might be due to the complexity of the mathematical notation in the images, which can be challenging for OCR software to interpret accurately.
Given the situation, I will analyze the image directly to interpret the equation and then proceed with the calculation. Let's start by examining the original image to read the equation. 
The equation is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine of 
π times the quantity of 
cos(
2
πx
)+
2
7
.
The equation in mathematical notation is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(cos(
2
πx
)+
2
7
))
Let's calculate this. 
The answer is 
0. This result indicates that the summation of the given function across the specified range yields a total sum of zero.
