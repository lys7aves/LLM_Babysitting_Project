To calculate the given expression, we'll break it down step by step. The expression is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the function:
f(x)=x
2
−sin(
2
−5
sin(
2
πx
))π
Let's compute this step by step:
Calculate 
x
2
 for each 
x from 1 to 10.
Compute the sine function for each 
x, specifically 
sin(
2
πx
).
Multiply that result by 
2
−5
 and then take the sine of the entire expression.
Multiply that result by 
π.
Subtract the result from step 3 from 
x
2
 to get the value of the function for each 
x.
Sum up all the function values from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's perform these calculations.
The answer is approximately 386.88.
