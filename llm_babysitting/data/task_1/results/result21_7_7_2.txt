The mathematical expression from the images is a summation formula, which is written as follows:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
π
(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
This expression means that we are to calculate the cosine of a sine-transformed value, then divide by 2, for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then sum the results.
Now let's calculate this expression using Python.
The answer is approximately 5.22.
