To approach this task, we'll need to:
Interpret the Expression: Understand the mathematical expression presented in the images.
Calculate the Expression: Compute the value of the expression.
Firstly, let's interpret the expression from the original image and the lattice images.
The expression is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
−3x
2
+x.
Now, we can calculate this expression using Python. We will write a loop to sum the value of 
−3x
2
+x for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is 
−1100.
