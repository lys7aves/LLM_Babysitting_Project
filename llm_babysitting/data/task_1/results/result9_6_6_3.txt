The mathematical expression depicted in the images is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine of 
π times 
x+

:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(x+

))
To compute this, we can use the properties of the sine function, especially the fact that sine is periodic with period 
2π. This means that for integral multiples of 
π, the sine function will yield well-known values.
The sine function is also known to be 
0 at multiples of 
π, 
1 at odd multiples of 
π
2
π
, and 
−1 at even multiples of 
π
2
π
 (excluding multiples of 
π).
Now, let's calculate this expression using Python.
The answer is 
0.
This result makes sense because the sine function is symmetric around multiples of 
π, and since the expression 
π(x+
2

) hits these symmetric points an even number of times within the range of summation, their contributions cancel each other out.
