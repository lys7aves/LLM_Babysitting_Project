The images you've uploaded appear to be different representations of the same mathematical expression. The images are not directly accessible by me, but I can guide you through the steps to interpret the expression and calculate its value.
Firstly, let's understand the expression based on your description. The expression is a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of the sine of a cosine function. The cosine function includes a multiple of 
π and an addition of 
5
2
5
 to the variable 
x. The entire cosine function is then divided by 2 before being passed into the sine function.
To read the expression accurately, we should check for:
The limits of the summation (which is from 1 to 10).
The argument of the sine function, which is a cosine function.
The argument of the cosine function, which includes 
π, the variable 
x, and the addition of 
5
2

, all divided by 2.
Assuming that the expression is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
We can now calculate this expression step by step. We'll calculate the value for each 
x from 1 to 10 and then sum these values to get the final result.
Let's proceed to calculate the value using Python.
The answer is approximately 
−2.14×10
−14
. Given the very small magnitude of this number, it can be considered effectively zero within the precision limits of floating-point arithmetic used in computational calculations. This result suggests that the sum of the given expression is zero, which could be due to the symmetry of the sine function over the specified range.
