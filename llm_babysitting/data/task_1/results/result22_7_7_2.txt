The images contain a mathematical expression involving a summation and trigonometric functions. To evaluate the expression, I need to first read it correctly from the images provided.
Looking at the images, the expression seems to be a complex fraction, where the numerator itself is a fraction, and the denominator contains a summation. The expression inside the brackets, which forms the numerator of the upper fraction, seems to be a trigonometric identity involving sine and cosine functions.
The expression appears to be:
∑
x=1
10
sin(4πsinx)
2
πsin(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
Now, to calculate this expression, we would need to evaluate the summation in the denominator for x values from 1 to 10 and then calculate the numerator. Since the sine and cosine functions are involved, this will likely result in a transcendental number that cannot be expressed exactly in a simple form.
Let's proceed to calculate the expression using Python.
The value of the expression, after calculation, is approximately 
−2.83×10
−16
.
Given the small magnitude of this result, it's close to zero within the precision of floating-point arithmetic. This could indicate that the numerator and denominator are nearly equal, or it could be due to a cancelation of terms in the summation.
Thus, the answer is approximately 
0.
