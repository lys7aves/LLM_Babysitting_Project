The expression from the images is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
(x+sin
4
(
2
πx
))
Now, I will calculate this expression using Python. This involves iterating over each integer value of x from 1 to 10, calculating 
x+sin
4
(
2
πx
) for each, and summing the results. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is 60.
