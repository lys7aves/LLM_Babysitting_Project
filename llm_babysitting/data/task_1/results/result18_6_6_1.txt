The mathematical expression in both images is the same. It represents a summation where 
x takes integer values from 1 to 10. The function inside the summation is the cosine of half the product of 
π and the sine of 
π times the quantity 
2
x
3
−1. Mathematically, this can be written as:
x=1
∑
10
cos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(π(
2
x
3
−1))
⎠
⎞
To calculate this expression, we will evaluate the cosine term for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and then sum the results. Let's proceed with the calculation using Python.
The answer is exactly 5.0.
