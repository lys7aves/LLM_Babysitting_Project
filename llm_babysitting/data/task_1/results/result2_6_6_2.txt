Firstly, let's interpret the mathematical expression shown in the images. The expression is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
(10+x−2x)
This expression tells us to sum up the values of 
(10+x−2x) for each integer 
x starting from 1 to 10.
Before calculating, let's simplify the expression inside the summation:
10+x−2x=10−x
Now, the simplified expression we need to sum is:
∑
x=1
10
(10−x)
We will calculate this using Python.
The answer is 45.
