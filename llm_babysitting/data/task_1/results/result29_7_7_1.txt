The provided images appear to be of a mathematical expression with the use of summation notation and trigonometric functions. However, due to the format of this interaction, I cannot directly view these images. Instead, I will rely on your description.
The expression, based on your description of the images, seems to be:
∑
x=1
10
sin
⎝
⎛
2
πcos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
⎠
⎞
This is a nested trigonometric function inside a summation from 1 to 10. To calculate this expression, I'll evaluate the innermost function first and proceed outwards, iterating over each value of 
x from 1 to 10. Let's compute this using Python.
The answer is 
5.0.
