To correctly read the mathematical expression from the provided images, we need to analyze the original image and compare it with the lattice-imposed versions to determine the accurate positioning of the symbols and understand the structure of the expression.
Starting with the original image, it looks like a summation notation combined with a fraction inside a trigonometric function, but to ensure accuracy, I will compare it to the lattice-imposed images which should help clarify the relative positions of the symbols, especially the exponents and the indices.
After reviewing the images, the expression can be read as:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
Now that the expression is correctly read, we can proceed to calculate it using Python. I'll write the necessary code to evaluate this expression numerically.
The answer is 
5.0.
