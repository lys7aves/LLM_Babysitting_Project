The images you've provided seem to be different representations of a mathematical expression. The lattices overlaid on the images are likely used to aid in determining the correct positioning of the elements within the expression.
To begin with, let's analyze the original image and determine the mathematical expression it represents. Then, we can use the images with the lattice to confirm the structure of the expression, paying special attention to the positioning of the elements, such as whether certain parts are superscripts or subscripts, or inside a fraction or a function's argument.
Once we have the correct expression, I will calculate the value using Python. Let's start by examining the original image to understand the mathematical expression. I will describe the expression as I interpret it:
There is a summation symbol with the upper limit of 10 and the lower limit of 1.
The expression being summed appears to be a fraction.
The numerator is a product of π (pi) and the sine of another expression.
The denominator is simply 2.
The sine in the numerator takes an argument that is itself a fraction, with π times the sine of another expression in the numerator, and 2 in the denominator.
The sine in the numerator's argument also takes an argument, which appears to be 
π
2
πx
.
Therefore, the complete expression appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
2
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
Now let's confirm this interpretation by comparing the image with the various lattices. If everything is correct, I will proceed to calculate the expression.
Upon reviewing the images with the 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 lattices, the expression can be confirmed as:
x=1
∑
10
2
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
This expression is complex, involving nested sine functions and a summation. We'll calculate this using Python by iterating over the values of 
x from 1 to 10, calculating the inner sine function, then the outer sine function, and summing the results after multiplying by 
π
2
π
. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is approximately 
1.5708, which is in fact 
2
π
 when rounded to four decimal places. This result makes sense because 
π radians is equal to 180 degrees, and hence 
π
2
π
 is 90 degrees. The sine of 90 degrees is 1, so we are left with the sum of 
π
2
π
 ten times, which would indeed yield 
π
