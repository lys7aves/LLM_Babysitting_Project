To calculate the expression given in the image, we'll proceed step by step.
The expression is a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of the sine of a complex fraction involving 
π. Let's break it down:
Inside the sine function, we have a multiplication of 
π and a cosine of a fraction which itself includes 
π, sine, and cosine functions.
The innermost part is 
πcos(
2
πx
). We need to evaluate this for each 
x from 1 to 10.
The result of this will then be multiplied by 
π and then put inside the sine function.
Finally, we sum up the results of the sine function for each 
x from 1 to 10.
Given that the cosine function has a period of 
2π and it equals zero at odd multiples of 
π
2
π
, and 
sin(πk)=0 for any integer 
k, the value of the expression may simplify greatly.
Let's calculate the summation.
The answer is 
0.
