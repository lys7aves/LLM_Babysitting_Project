To start, I'll compare the two images based on the lattice provided in the second image to ensure the mathematical expression is read correctly.
The expression in the images is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
(x+sin
4
(
2
πx
))
This is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
x plus the fourth power of the sine of 
π
2
πx
.
Now, I will calculate the sum of this expression.
The answer is 
60.0.
