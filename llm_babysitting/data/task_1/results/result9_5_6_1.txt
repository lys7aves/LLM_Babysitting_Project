It appears that the OCR process did not successfully extract the equation from the images. This could be due to the complexity of the mathematical notation, which OCR can sometimes struggle with. Since the OCR approach was not successful, I will manually interpret the equation from the images and then proceed to solve it.
The equation in the images is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
Now let's calculate the sum. 
The answer is 
0.
The summation of the sine function across the given range results in zero. This is because 
sin(π⋅(x+
2
3
)) evaluates to 
sin(π⋅x+
2
3π
), which is the same as 
−sin(π⋅x) due to the periodic nature of the sine function. The values of 
−sin(π⋅x) at integer multiples of 
π are all zero, thus the summation of these terms results in zero.
