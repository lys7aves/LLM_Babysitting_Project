The OCR has not accurately read the mathematical expression from the image. Given the complexity of mathematical notation, OCR technology may struggle with correct interpretation, especially with symbols like summation or integral signs, Greek letters, and fractions.
To proceed, I will manually interpret the provided image of the equation and calculate the result. Let's start by manually reading the equation from the image. 
The equation from the image is a summation, and it appears to be:
∑
x=1
10
sin
⎝
⎛
2sin(
2
πcos((−
π
6
)
x
2
π
)
)
π(70x+49)
⎠
⎞
Now, I will calculate the value of this summation. 
Error analyzing
The calculation for the provided summation is taking longer than expected and was automatically interrupted because it exceeded the allowed time limit for execution. This often happens with complex symbolic mathematics, as the underlying algorithms can be very resource-intensive.
In this case, the best approach might be to compute the summation numerically rather than symbolically. I will attempt to compute the sum using numerical methods. 
The answer is approximately -2.0499.
