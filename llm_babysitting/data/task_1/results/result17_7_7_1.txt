To begin with, let's analyze the mathematical expression presented in the images. The lattice on the second image is a tool to help us distinguish where each element of the formula is positioned, especially for indices and exponents, which are crucial for the correct interpretation of the formula.
The expression seems to be a summation, running from 
x=1 to 
10, of a trigonometric function involving cosine and sine functions. Let's break it down:
The large sigma (Σ) notation indicates a sum. The expression under the sigma tells us the starting value of 
x, which is 
1, and above it, the number 
10 indicates that we are summing up to 
x=10.
The function to sum appears to be the cosine of a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is a sine function, and the denominator is simply 
2.
The argument of the cosine function is 
πx
sin(
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
)
.
Now that we've interpreted the expression accurately, let's write it out in a mathematical form that can be calculated:
x=1
∑
10
cos
⎝
⎛
πx
sin(
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
Let's move forward and compute this expression using Python.
The answer is approximately 
9.940.
