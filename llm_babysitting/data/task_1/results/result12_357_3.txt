To address your request, I will first compare the images to ensure that I accurately interpret the mathematical expression they represent. Then, I will calculate the result of the expression.
By examining the images, we can see that they all represent a summation expression. The summation appears to be from 
x=1 to 
x=10. The expression being summed is 
(−7)
x
−9.
Now, I will calculate the value of this summation using Python.
The answer is 247,165,752.
