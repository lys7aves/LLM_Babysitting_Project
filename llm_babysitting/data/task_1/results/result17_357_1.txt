To proceed with the calculation, I will first accurately interpret the mathematical expression from the original image, using the additional images with lattice overlays as a guide to ensure correct positioning of symbols, superscripts, and subscripts.
Once I have the correct expression, I will use Python to compute the value of the expression. Let's start by interpreting the mathematical expression. From the original image, it looks like a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of a cosine function, where the argument of the cosine function is a fraction involving sine functions.
Given the precision required to determine the correct expression, I'll carefully examine the relative positions of symbols in the lattice-overlaid images to confirm superscripts and subscripts. After this, I will proceed with the calculation.
The expression from the original image is a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 and the argument of the cosine is a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is 
sin(
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
) and the denominator is 
2πx. Therefore, the full expression is:
x=1
∑
10
cos
⎝
⎛
2πx
sin(
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
Now I'll use Python to calculate this expression.
The answer is approximately 
9.985.
