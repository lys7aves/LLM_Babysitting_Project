To solve the given mathematical expression, we'll first need to accurately read the expression from the images provided. Let's start by comparing the two images:
The expression is comprised of multiple nested fractions and trigonometric functions.
We need to pay attention to the superscripts, subscripts, and the overall structure of the expression.
Based on the provided lattice, the expression can be interpreted as follows:
2
πsin
⎝
⎛
2
πcos(
2
π
+
2
sin(
2
πx
)
)
+
2
81
⎠
⎞
Now that we've read the expression, let's proceed to calculate it step by step for 
x=1 to 
x=10 and sum the results as indicated by the summation symbol 
∑
x=1
10
.
I'll now perform the calculation using Python.
The answer is approximately 
5.55165728544086.
