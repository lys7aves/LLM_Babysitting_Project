To calculate the given summation expression, we have:
x=1
∑
10
(x+1)
This is a finite arithmetic series where each term is the previous term plus 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:
k=1
∑
n
(a
k
)=
2
n
(2a
1
+(n−1)d)
Where 
n is the number of terms, 
a
1
 is the first term, and 
d is the common difference between the terms. In our case, 
a
1
=1+1=2, 
n=10, and 
d=1 since each term is one more than the previous term.
Let's calculate the sum.
The answer is 65.
