The expression simplifies to a sum of sine functions of integer multiples of π, which cannot be further simplified symbolically:
sin(5)+sin(4)+sin(10)+sin(6)+sin(3)+sin(9)+sin(7)+sin(1)+sin(2)+sin(8)
However, since sine functions have a period of 
2π, the terms involving multiples of 
π will evaluate to 0 or other simple values. Let's compute the numerical values for each of these sine terms. 
The numerical values for the sine functions are as follows:
sin(1)≈0.8415
sin(2)≈0.9093
sin(3)≈0.1411
sin(4)≈−0.7568
sin(5)≈−0.9589
sin(6)≈−0.2794
sin(7)≈0.6570
sin(8)≈0.9894
sin(9)≈0.4121
sin(10)≈−0.5440
When summed together, the numerical sum of the expression is approximately 
1.4112.
