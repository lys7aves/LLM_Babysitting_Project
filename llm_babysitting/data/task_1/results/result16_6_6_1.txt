Let's start by interpreting the mathematical expression given in the images.
The expression is a summation, and we can read it as follows:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
Now, we can proceed to calculate this expression step by step.
We will calculate the innermost expression first, which is 
π
2
πx
 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
We will then apply the sine function to these results, 
sin(
2
πx
).
Multiply the result by 
π and divide by 2.
Apply the cosine function to these results.
Sum up all the values of cosine from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's perform these calculations using Python.
The answer is exactly 5.0.
