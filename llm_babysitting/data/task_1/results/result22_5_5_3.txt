The images above show a mathematical expression with complex fractions and a summation. The expression to be evaluated is:
2
(∑
x=1
10
sin(x)−sin(4π))sin(π)
÷
2
sin(π)cos(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
Next, we'll calculate this expression step by step. Since 
sin(π)=0, any term multiplied by 
sin(π) will be zero. However, for completeness, we will calculate all parts of the expression. We will evaluate the summation, the sine and cosine terms, and then simplify the expression accordingly. 
The summation 
∑
x=1
10
sin(x) yields approximately 1.4112, and 
sin(4π) is 0. The term 
sin(π) is also 0. Given that the expression involves multiplication by 
sin(π), the entire expression evaluates to 0.
The answer is 0.
