To begin the analysis, let's consider the expression given in the first image. Based on the standard mathematical notation and the provided lattice images for reference, we can deduce the structure of the mathematical expression. It is a summation expression that runs from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
In the expression, there are three terms within the summation: a constant 10, an 
x, and a 
−2x which is raised to a power because it is located at the top-right part of the 
x term, indicating that it is a superscript. The negative sign and the 
2 are at the same height, suggesting that they are together, and the 
x is slightly lower, meaning it is the base of the exponent.
The correct reading of the expression would be:
x=1
∑
10
(10+x−2
x
)
Now, let's calculate the value of this summation using Python.
The answer is -1891.
