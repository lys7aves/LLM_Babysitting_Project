First, I'll compare the expressions from the original image and the one with the lattice to confirm the mathematical expression. Then I'll proceed to calculate the value of that expression.
Given the images and the lattice for precise location information, I can see that the expression is:
âˆ‘
x=1
10
(
x
2/5
1
+(x
x
))
Now I will calculate this expression using Python.
The answer is approximately 
10,405,071,322.698.
