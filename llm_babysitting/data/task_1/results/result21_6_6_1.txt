The expressions from the two images are as follows:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
Let's calculate this step by step.
We evaluate the innermost part, which involves the variable 
x. The expression 
2
x
+
2
3
 will be evaluated for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
We then take the sine of the result of the above expression, multiplied by 
π.
We then divide this result by 2 and take the cosine of that.
Finally, we sum up all the cosine values we get from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's compute this using Python.
The answer is 
5.0.
