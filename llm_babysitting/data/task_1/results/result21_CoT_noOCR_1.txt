To calculate the expression given in the image, we will evaluate the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of the quantity 
2
π
sin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
)).
The expression inside the cosine is a sinusoidal function which may produce results that are easily recognizable as standard angles. We can proceed to evaluate this sum manually using Python to assist with the calculations. Let's start by calculating the value of this expression for each value of 
x from 1 to 10.
The answer is 5.
