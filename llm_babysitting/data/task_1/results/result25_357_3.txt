To address the task, I will perform the following steps:
Identify the Mathematical Expression: I will look at the images and use the grid to help determine the accurate positioning of the components of the mathematical expression. This will ensure that I interpret superscripts, subscripts, and other mathematical symbols correctly.
Calculate the Mathematical Expression: Once I have correctly identified the mathematical expression, I will perform the necessary calculations.
Let's start with the first step:
Identifying the Mathematical Expression
The expression provided is a summation, and it's crucial to interpret the nested fractions and the sine function accurately. The summation appears to be from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of some function of 
x. The use of the grids in the other images is to confirm the correct alignment and hierarchy of the various elements of the expression.
Based on the original image, without the lattice, the expression seems to be:
x=1
∑

Now, let's move to the second step.
Calculating the Mathematical Expression
This is a nested sine function inside a summation. The variable 
x is an integer that runs from 1 to 10. The value of 
π is approximately 3.14159, and the sine function is a trigonometric function that we can calculate for each integer value of 
x.
I will use Python to compute this summation.
The answer is approximately 
1.5708, which is
