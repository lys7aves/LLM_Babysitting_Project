The mathematical expression in the image you've uploaded is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine of the cosine of 
π times 
(x+
2
5
) divided by 
2:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
To compute this, we will calculate each term in the sum individually and then add them together. Let's start the calculation using Python.
The sum of the expression evaluates to approximately 
−2.14×10
−14
, which is essentially zero within the precision of floating-point arithmetic.
The answer is approximately zero.
