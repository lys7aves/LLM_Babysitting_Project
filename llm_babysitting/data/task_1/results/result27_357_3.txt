I will analyze the mathematical expression from the original image and then use the images with the lattice overlay to verify the positioning of the elements within the expression.
The expression is:
∑
x=1
10
sin
x
(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
This is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine function to the 
xth power, with the argument of the sine function being 
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
.
Now, let's proceed to calculate the value of this expression using Python.
The answer is 
5.0.
