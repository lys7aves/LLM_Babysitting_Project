The mathematical expression depicted in the images is the summation notation. The original expression is clear and reads as follows:
∑
x=1
10
(x+1)
This means we are to sum the values of 
(x+1) for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
Let's calculate this sum.
The sum of the expression 
∑
x=1
10
(x+1) is 65.
Therefore, the answer is 65.
