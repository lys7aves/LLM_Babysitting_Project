The first step is to compare the two images and ensure that the mathematical expression is read correctly. The lattice overlay in the second image is designed to assist in precise location, which is crucial for mathematical notation where the position of numbers and symbols relative to one another can change the meaning of the expression.
From the description, the expression is:
x=1
∑
10
(−3x
2
+x)
This is a summation expression where 
x runs from 1 to 10, and for each 
x, the quantity 
−3x
2
+x is computed and added to the sum.
To calculate this expression, I'll compute the sum programmatically by plugging in the values from 1 to 10 for 
x into the expression 
−3x
2
+x and summing the results. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is 
−1100.
