The expression shown in the images is a summation, which can be read as:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
π
(x
3
−1))
)
This is the sum of the cosine of the quantity 
2
πsin(
2
π
(x
3
−1))
 as 
x goes from 1 to 10.
To calculate the value of this expression, I will evaluate the inside of the cosine for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, take the cosine of that result, and then sum all the cosine values together. Let's perform this calculation using Python.
The answer is 
5.0.
