Let's start by examining the mathematical expression provided in the images. Based on the description, it seems that the expression is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
))
To compute this, we will perform the following steps:
For each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, calculate the value of 
cos(
2
πx
).
Divide the result by 2 and add 
7
2
7
.
Take the sine of the entire expression multiplied by 
π.
Sum the results of the sine function for each value of 
x.
Let's calculate this expression step by step using Python.
The answer is 
−5.0.
