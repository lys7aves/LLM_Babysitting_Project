To calculate the expression, we'll need to break it down into more manageable parts. Let's go through it step by step:
Summation: The large sigma notation indicates a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10. This means that whatever expression follows will be calculated for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and all those results will be added together.
Cosine term: Inside the summation, there's a cosine function. We'll have to calculate 
cos(x) for each 
x in the range given by the summation.
Fraction term: The fraction inside the square brackets is a complex expression involving trigonometric functions of 
π and 
x. The numerator is 
πsin(π)×9cos(
2
πx+sin(
2
πx
)
). Since 
sin(π) is zero, this entire term will be zero regardless of 
x.
The addition of 
81
2
81
 to the fraction: This term is not dependent on 
x and will be added to the sum after the summation is calculated.
Final division by 2: After the summation and addition of 
81
2
81
 is complete, the entire result is then divided by 2.
Given that the middle term in the fraction is zero (since 
sin(π)=0), the sum will effectively be the sum of 
cos(x) from 1 to 10 plus 
81
2
81
, and then all of that divided by 2.
Let's calculate this using Python.
The answer is approximately 
19.54.
