The images provided are not directly accessible for me to view, but based on your description, it appears you're asking for help with a mathematical expression that has been overlaid on various lattice grids for precision.
Given that I cannot view the images, I will rely on your description of the situation. The expression seems to involve a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the quantity 
x
2
 minus the sine of a fraction involving 
π, 
x, and another value that may be 
−
2
5
 or 
5
2
5
 multiplied by 
π.
The expression to be evaluated is:
∑
x=1
10
(x
2
−sin((−
2
5
)sin(
2
πx
)π))
Before proceeding to calculation, I must clarify the expression. Is the inside of the sine function 
−
2
5
sin(
2
πx
)π, or is there another interpretation based on the lattice images you've provided?
