The images you've uploaded seem to contain mathematical expressions with a summation notation. To accurately compare the two images, I'll describe the process I would follow:
Identify the mathematical expression in each image.
Note the limits of the summation and the function to be summed.
Look for any differences in the expressions that may have resulted from the superimposed lattice, which could affect the interpretation of the indices or the function itself.
Given that the lattice is there to provide precise location information, it's crucial to ensure that no elements of the expression are misinterpreted due to the lines of the lattice.
Since I am not using image recognition software, I'll rely on the provided description that the expressions in both images are the same. The expression given is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the function 
x
x
+9.
Let's calculate the sum 
âˆ‘
x=1
10
(x
x
+9).
To calculate this expression, I'll compute the value of 
x
x
 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, add 9 to each result, and then sum all these values. I'll use Python to carry out the computation.
The answer is
