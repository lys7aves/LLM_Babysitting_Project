The provided images contain mathematical expressions with summation notation. The first image presents a clear view of the expression, while the second includes a red lattice that overlays the expression for accurate positioning.
The expression in both images is the same and reads as follows:
âˆ‘
x=1
10
(x
x
+9)
This is a sum of terms from 
x=1 to 
x=10, where each term is the sum of 
x raised to the power of 
x and 9.
To calculate this expression, we'll evaluate 
x
x
 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, add 9 to each result, and then sum all these values together.
Let's calculate the sum.
The answer is 
10405071407.
