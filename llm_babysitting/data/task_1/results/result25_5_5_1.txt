The images show a mathematical expression involving a summation and trigonometric functions. From examining the images, the expression is:
x=1
∑
10

πx
)
)
To calculate the expression, we will compute the sum of the terms for 
x from 1 to 10 using the described trigonometric functions and the constant 
π. I will proceed to calculate this expression using Python.
The answer is approximately 
1.5708, which is actually
