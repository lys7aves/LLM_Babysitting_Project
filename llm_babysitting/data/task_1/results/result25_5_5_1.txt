It appears that the OCR process was not able to correctly read the text from the image of the equation. I will attempt a different method to try and accurately capture and calculate the equation from the image. Let's proceed with a manual analysis of the equation. 
The OCR process with the image containing the lattice has provided bounding boxes, but the text recognition is still not accurate enough to extract the mathematical expression directly.
Based on the image with the lattice, we can manually transcribe the mathematical expression and then calculate it. The expression appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
sin
x
(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
I will now proceed to calculate this expression. 
The answer is 1.0.
