The expression in the images is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the function:
sin(
2
πcos(πcos(
2
πx
))
)
To calculate this, we will evaluate the innermost expression first, which is 
cos(
2
πx
), then take the cosine of the result, multiply that by 
π, take the cosine of this new result, divide by 2, and finally take the sine of the entire expression. We'll sum this value for 
x from 1 to 10.
Let's perform the calculations using Python.
The answer is 
0.
This result suggests that the sum of the given trigonometric expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is zero. This could be due to the symmetry and periodicity of the trigonometric functions involved, which may cause the positive and negative parts to cancel each other out over the interval of summation.
