The first step is to accurately read the mathematical expression from the images provided. The additional images with grids overlaid can help us to determine the exact positioning of each element in the expression.
The expression, based on the original image, seems to be a summation:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
With the lattice images, we can confirm the positioning of each component, especially the fractions and the indices of the summation.
Now that we have the correct expression, we can proceed to calculate its value using Python. Let's go ahead and compute this summation.
The answer is approximately 
−2.14×10
−14
. However, considering the nature of trigonometric functions and the fact that this is a very small number close to zero, we can conclude that the exact mathematical answer is 
0. This result is likely due to rounding errors in the computation since the sine of a multiple of 
π is mathematically zero.
