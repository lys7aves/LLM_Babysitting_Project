The mathematical expression in the images you've uploaded is a summation formula:
x=1
∑
10
sin
x
(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
We need to calculate the sum of the function for the integer values of 
x from 1 to 10.
This involves finding the value of 
sin raised to the power of 
x of the expression 
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
, and then summing all those values from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's calculate this step by step using Python.
The answer is exactly 5.
