The images you've provided appear to be variations of a mathematical expression with different lattice overlays to aid in determining the relative positions of elements in the expression. Since I can't view images directly, I'll rely on the description provided.
The original expression seems to be a summation:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
))
To calculate this expression, we need to evaluate the sine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, where 
x is also part of an inner cosine function.
We will follow these steps:
Calculate the inner cosine for each 
x as 
cos(
2
πx
).
Divide the result of the cosine by 2 and add 
7
2
7
.
Apply the sine function to the result of step 2 multiplied by 
π.
Sum up all the sine values for each 
x from 1 to 10.
Now, I will perform the calculation.
The answer is 
−5.0.
