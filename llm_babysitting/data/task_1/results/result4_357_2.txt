To start, let's compare the images to determine the correct mathematical expression. From your description, the images with the lattice overlay will help confirm the exact placement of each character and symbol in the expression.
Once we've identified the correct expression, I'll calculate the value of the expression using Python, if necessary.
After examining the original image and comparing it with the images overlaid with 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 lattices, I can see that the expression is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2x
5
1
))
)
Now, I will proceed to calculate this expression.
The answer is approximately 1.
