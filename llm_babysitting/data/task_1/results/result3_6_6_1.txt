To address your request, I will follow the steps you've outlined. Let's begin with the first part, which is to compare the two images and read the expression correctly.
The expression in the images provided is a summation notation, which reads as:
x=1
∑
10
(3x
2
+∣x∣)
Now that we have accurately read the expression, we can proceed to calculate it. We will evaluate the sum of the function 
3x
2
+∣x∣ as 
x ranges from 1 to 10.
I will now use Python to calculate the final answer.
The answer is 1210.
