To calculate the given expression step by step, let's first understand the mathematical notation and then proceed with the calculation:
The given expression is a summation, indicated by the sigma notation 
∑, which tells us to sum the values of the function to the right of it for the given range of x, which in this case is from 1 to 10.
The function to sum is:
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
We will need to evaluate this function for each integer value of x from 1 to 10 and then sum those values.
Let's proceed with the calculation using Python to perform the summation and cosine evaluations.
The answer is 5.0.
