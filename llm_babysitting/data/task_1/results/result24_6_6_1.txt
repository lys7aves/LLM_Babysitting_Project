The images you have uploaded depict a mathematical expression. The expression is a summation from x equals 1 to 10 of the sine of a quantity. This quantity is pi times the cosine of pi times x divided by 2, plus 7 over 2.
The summation expression is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(cos(
2
πx
)+
2
7
))
To calculate this expression, we will evaluate the sine function for each integer value of x from 1 to 10, where x is input into the cosine function multiplied by pi/2, add 7/2 to the result, and then multiply by pi before taking the sine.
Let's calculate the value of this summation using Python.
The answer is 0.0.
This result suggests that the sum of the expression as defined, over the integers from 1 to 10, is zero. This could be due to the periodic nature of the sine and cosine functions, which can lead to the summation of certain terms canceling each other out.
