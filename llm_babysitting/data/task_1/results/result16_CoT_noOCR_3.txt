To calculate the given expression:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
We will evaluate the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10. The key part of this expression is to understand how the sine function behaves when multiplied by 
π
2
π
, as this will influence the output of the cosine function.
The sine function has a period of 
2π, so when we multiply 
x by 
π
2
π
, we are essentially looking at the sine function at different points of its period.
Let's calculate this step by step using Python.
The answer is 
5.
