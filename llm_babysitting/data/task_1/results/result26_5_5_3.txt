The expression from the images is:
∑
x=1
10
(x+sin
4
(
2
πx
))
Now, I'll calculate this expression step by step.
The summation indicates that we need to sum the expression 
x+sin

(
2
πx
) for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
The 
sin
4
(⋅) notation indicates the sine of the argument, raised to the fourth power.
Let's proceed with the calculation.
