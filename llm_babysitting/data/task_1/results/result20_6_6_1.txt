The expression shown in both images is a mathematical sum expressed as a sigma notation. The expression inside the sum is 
(x+1), and the sum runs from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
To calculate the sum, we will perform the following steps:
Identify the expression to be summed: In this case, 
(x+1).
Plug in the values of 
x from 1 to 10 into the expression 
(x+1) and add them up.
The sum can be calculated by evaluating the expression 
(x+1) for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and adding the results together. This is equivalent to the sum of an arithmetic sequence where each term is one more than the previous term, starting at 2 and ending at 11.
Let's calculate this using Python.
The answer is 
65.
