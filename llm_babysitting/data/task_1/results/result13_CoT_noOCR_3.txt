To calculate the given expression, we will evaluate the summation. The expression inside the summation is 
−8×(−1)
x
×(cos(
2
πx
)+10), which we will evaluate for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
Let's break it down:
(−1)
x
 will alternate between -1 and 1 for odd and even values of 
x, respectively.
cos(
2
πx
) will have a pattern depending on 
x. Specifically, 
cos of multiples of 
π will be -1, 0, or 1. For 
π
2
π
, 
3
2
3π
, and so on, the cosine function will be 0.
Adding 10 to the cosine function will shift the result of the cosine by 10 units up.
Now, let's compute this in Python.
The answer is 8.
