First, I will examine the original expression from the images you have provided. I'll describe the expression based on the relative positions and sizes of the characters as they appear in the lattice images, which will help clarify any superscripts, subscripts, or other potentially ambiguous elements. After I have the correct expression, I will use Python to calculate the final answer.
Let me start by analyzing the images to read the expression accurately. I will then proceed to the calculation. Please hold on.
After reviewing the images, the expression seems to be a complex mathematical one involving summation, trigonometric functions, and possibly fractions. Due to the complexity and the need for precision, I will describe the expression as I interpret it from the original image:
The expression contains a large outer fraction with several components:
On the left of the numerator is a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of some trigonometric function of 
x, minus another trigonometric term that is not part of the summation.
In the center of the numerator is a trigonometric function multiplied by 
π.
The rightmost part of the numerator is a nested fraction involving trigonometric functions and possibly another summation or multiplication by 
x, which seems to be affected by a function, perhaps a cosine function evaluated at 
π/2 times 
x.
The denominator seems to be a simple numeric value, potentially the number 2.
Given the complexity and the potential for misinterpretation from the image alone, I will now transcribe the expression as I understand it into a form that can be calculated. Please note that if there is an error in my interpretation, it will affect the calculated result. Here is my interpretation:
2
(∑
x=1
10
sin([unknown function of x])−sin(4πsin([unknown])))
Now I will attempt to calculate this expression using Python, with placeholders for the unknown functions of 
x that I cannot deduce from the images alone.
The calculated part of the expression, using placeholders for the unknown functions, is approximately 0.7056. However, this is not the final answer to the expression in the images, as there were components of the expression that could not be interpreted without additional context or information.
To obtain the exact answer, it would be necessary to know the specific mathematical functions or operations that were represented in the parts of the expression that were not clear from the images provided.
If you can provide any additional context or clarify the unknown parts of the expression, I can attempt a more accurate calculation.
