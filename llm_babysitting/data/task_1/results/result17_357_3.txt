To solve the problem, I will first examine the original mathematical expression and then use the lattice-imposed versions to ensure that I have the correct interpretation of the indices and other elements of the formula. After I am confident that I have the correct expression, I will proceed to calculate the value of the expression.
Let's start by interpreting the expression from the original image. It appears to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of a trigonometric function. I'll examine the details carefully, comparing the different lattice versions to ensure accuracy. Once I have the correct expression, I'll use Python to calculate its value.
Upon reviewing the images, I have determined the mathematical expression they represent is as follows:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
sin(πx)
)
Now, I'll use Python to calculate the sum of this expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is approximately 
8.882751769603686.
