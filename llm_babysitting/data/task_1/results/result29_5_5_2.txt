The OCR results for the images are not providing a coherent mathematical expression, which is likely due to the complexity of the notation and the layout of the formula in the image. I will now try to manually interpret the mathematical expression from the images provided.
Let's start by examining the original image without the lattice to understand the structure of the mathematical expression. Once I have a clear understanding of the expression, I will proceed to calculate its value. Please give me a moment to review the images. 
The expression in the original image is a summation and it appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
sin
⎝
⎛
2
πcos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
⎠
⎞
To calculate this expression, I'll write a Python function that computes the summation for 
x from 1 to 10. I will then use this function to find the value of the entire expression. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The answer is exactly 5.0.
