To correctly interpret the mathematical expression from the images, we'll use the lattice overlays as guides to accurately read any subscripts, superscripts, or other mathematical notation that may be present.
The expression, as it appears in the original and the overlaid images, is a summation:
x=1
∑
10
(−3x
2
+x)
Now that we have confirmed the expression, let's calculate its value.
To do this, we will compute the summation of the expression for 
x ranging from 1 to 10. We'll use Python to perform this calculation.
The answer is -1100.
