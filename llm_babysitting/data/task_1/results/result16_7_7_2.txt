The expression given in the images is a mathematical summation. The main elements of the expression are:
A summation sign 
∑ indicating that a sum should be calculated.
The lower limit of the summation is 
x=1.
The upper limit of the summation is 10.
The expression inside the summation is a cosine function 
cos of a fraction.
The numerator of the fraction is a product of 
π and the sine of another fraction.
The inner fraction has 
πx in the numerator and 2 in the denominator, so the argument for the sine function is 
π
2
πx
.
The denominator outside the sine function is 2.
Therefore, the mathematical expression can be read as:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
To calculate this expression, I will use Python to compute the sum of the cosine of 
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
 for 
x going from 1 to 10. Let's calculate this now.
The answer is exactly 5.0.
