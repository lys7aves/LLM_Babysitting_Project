The first step in understanding the given mathematical expression is to accurately read and interpret it. The expression is a summation that runs from 
x=1 to 
x=10. Within the summation, the expression to be summed is 
x+sin
4
(
2
Ï€x
).
Now, to calculate this expression, we will compute each term of the summation individually and then sum them up. The sine function can have values between -1 and 1, and since we are raising it to the fourth power, the result will always be positive or zero. This means we can calculate the sine term directly without worrying about negative values due to the even exponent.
The Python code will be used to sum the expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is 
60.0.
