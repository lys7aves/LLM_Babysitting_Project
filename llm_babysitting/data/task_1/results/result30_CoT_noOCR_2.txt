The expression you've given is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the function 
x
2
−sin(
2
−5sin(
2
πx
)
)π.
Let's break this down:
x
2
 is straightforward; we'll just square each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
The sine function 
sin(
2
−5sin(
2
πx
)
) involves an inner sine function with argument 
π
2
πx
, which will have a period of 4 (since sine has a period of 
2π and 
(π/2)
2π
=4). This means that the inner sine function will repeat its values every four integer values of 
x. The result of this inner sine function is then multiplied by 
−5 and divided by 
2 before being used as the argument for the outer sine function.
Finally, we multiply the result of the sine function by 
π.
We will compute this summation step by step using Python. Let's start by calculating the value of the summation.
The answer is approximately 
386.88.
