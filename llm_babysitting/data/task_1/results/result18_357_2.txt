ChatGPT
I will begin by examining the original image to read the mathematical expression it represents. Then, I will verify the expression against the images with the lattices overlaid to ensure that subscripts, superscripts, and other mathematical notations are interpreted correctly.
Once I have the correct expression, I'll proceed to calculate its value using Python.
First, let's interpret the expression from the original image. The expression appears to be a summation:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
3
−1))
)
I will now proceed to calculate this expression using Python.
The answer is 
5.0.
