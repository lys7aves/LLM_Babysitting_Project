First, let's examine the original mathematical expression and the three images provided to understand the expression accurately.
The original expression is a summation, as indicated by the large sigma symbol (
Σ). The expression inside the summation is 
−9x
−3
, and the summation runs from 
x=1 to 
x=10. This can be interpreted as summing the values of 
−9x
−3
 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
Now, to calculate the sum of 
−9x
−3
 from 
x=1 to 
x=10, we will sum the values of 
−9x
−3
 for each value of 
x in that range.
I will perform the calculation using Python.
The answer is approximately -10.7778.
