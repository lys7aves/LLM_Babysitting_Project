To calculate the given expression, we must evaluate the following sum:
∑
x=1
10
cos
x
(
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
)
However, before we proceed with the computation, we should notice that the cosine function has a period of 
2π, which means that 
cos(θ+2πk)=cos(θ) for any integer 
k. Furthermore, the cosine of an angle that is an integral multiple of 
π will result in a value of either 
1 or 
−1, depending on whether the multiple is even or odd.
Looking at the inner cosine term, 
cos(
2
πx
), for integer values of 
x, this term will be zero when 
x is an odd integer since it will represent cosine of 
π
2
π
, 
3
2
3π
, etc. And for even 
x, it will take values of 
1 or 
−1 since it will represent cosine of 
π, 
2π, etc.
This inner term, when zero, will make the whole term inside the cosine of the summand zero, and since 
cos(0)=1, the power of cosine will be 
1 for all odd 
x.
For even 
x, since the cosine term will be 
1 or 
−1, it will be multiplied by 
π
2
πx
, which may result in a cosine value that is not trivially 
1 or 
−1. In these cases, the power of cosine will not necessarily be 
1.
Let's calculate this sum in Python step by step.
