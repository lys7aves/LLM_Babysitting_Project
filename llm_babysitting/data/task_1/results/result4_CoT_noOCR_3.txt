Certainly! Let's calculate the given expression step by step.
The expression provided is a summation:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2x
5
1
))
)
This expression consists of the sine of a cosine function, which itself contains a linear term in 
x and a fractional term which decreases rapidly as 
x increases (since it's proportional to 
1/x
5
). The sum is taken over the first ten positive integers for 
x.
To calculate this, we will:
Calculate the term inside the cosine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
Take the cosine of this result.
Divide by 2 and then take the sine of the result.
Sum up all these sine values.
Let's proceed with these steps using Python.
The result of the summation is approximately 
1.0000. Therefore, the answer is approximately 
1.
