The provided images are mathematical expressions on different lattice grids, designed to help with the precise identification of the components of the mathematical formula they represent. However, without the capability to view these images, I cannot directly compare them or analyze their content.
Nonetheless, based on the description in the initial prompt, it seems you have provided four images of the same mathematical expression with different lattice overlays (3x3, 5x5, and 7x7, respectively) to help discern the correct placement of elements in the expression. Since the expression is not directly viewable by me, I will need you to describe the mathematical expression or provide the components so that I can assist you with the calculation.
Once you provide the mathematical expression in text form, I can certainly use Python to compute the result. Please provide the details of the mathematical expression for further assistance.
