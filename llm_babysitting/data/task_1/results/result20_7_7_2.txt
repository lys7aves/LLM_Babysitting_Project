The expression in both images is a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of 
(x+1). The presence of the lattice in the second image is used for precise location information to ensure the reading of the expression is accurate, but in this case, the expression is clear enough without requiring the lattice for interpretation.
The expression can be calculated mathematically by recognizing that this is an arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:
S=
2
n
×(a
1
+a
n
)
where 
S is the sum of the series, 
n is the number of terms, 
a
1
 is the first term, and 
a
n
 is the last term.
For the series 
(x+1) where 
x ranges from 1 to 10, the first term when 
x=1 is 
2 and the last term when 
x=10 is 
11.
So, we can calculate the sum as follows:
S=
2
10
×(2+11)
Let's compute this.
The answer is 65.
