The expression in the images can be interpreted as:
∑
x=1
10
(x
2
−sin(
2
(−5)sin(
2
πx
)
π))
This expression is a summation that starts at 
x=1 and ends at 
x=10. For each value of 
x, we are to calculate 
x
2
 and subtract from it the sine of a product involving 
π, 
x, and another sine function.
To calculate this, we will compute each term of the sum individually for 
x from 1 to 10, and then add up these terms to get the final result.
Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is 
386.0.
