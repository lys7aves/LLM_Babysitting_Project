To begin, we should carefully examine the mathematical expression provided in the original image and those represented on the various lattice grids. This will help to confirm the precise notation and components of the expression before performing the calculation.
The expression appears to be a summation, and based on the accurate positioning provided by the lattice overlays, we can decipher the limits of the summation and the terms involved.
Let's start by analyzing the original expression without the lattice and use that as a basis for comparison with the latticed images.
The original expression appears to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the terms 
−3x
2
+x.
The 3x3 lattice image should confirm the positioning of the numbers and variables.
The 5x5 lattice image provides even more precision, particularly for the placement of superscripts and coefficients.
The 7x7 lattice gives us the most detailed view, which should help us confirm the exact structure of the expression.
After confirming the expression using the different lattice resolutions, we can proceed to calculate the sum of 
−3x
2
+x from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's perform the calculation now.
The answer is -1100.
