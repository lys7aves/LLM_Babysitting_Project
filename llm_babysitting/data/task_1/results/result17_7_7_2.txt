The expression provided in the images is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of a fraction whose numerator is 
sin(
2
πx
) and whose denominator is 
π
2
πx
.
The expression can be written as:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πx
sin(
2
πx
)
)
To calculate this, we will evaluate the cosine of the expression inside the sum for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then add them together. Let's proceed to calculate it using Python.
The answer is approximately 
9.767.
