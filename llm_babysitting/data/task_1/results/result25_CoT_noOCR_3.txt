To calculate the given expression, we have a summation of 
sin(x) from 
x=1 to 
x=10 multiplied by 
2
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
. Let's break down the calculation into two parts:
Calculate the summation: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(x).
Multiply each term from the summation by 
2
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
 and then sum them up.
Let's start with step 1, which is to find the sum of 
sin(x) for 
x from 1 to 10. We'll then proceed to step 2.
The sum of 
sin(x) from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is approximately 1.4112.
After multiplying each term from this summation by 
2
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
 and summing them up, the final result of the entire expression is approximately -0.7908.
The answer is approximately -0.7908.
