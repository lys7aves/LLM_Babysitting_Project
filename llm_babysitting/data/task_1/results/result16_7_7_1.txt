The expression in both images can be interpreted as follows:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
This is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of half the product of 
π and the sine of 
π
2
πx
.
To calculate this sum, we'll evaluate the expression inside the cosine for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then take the cosine of the result. Let's proceed with the calculation in Python.
The answer is exactly 
5.0.
