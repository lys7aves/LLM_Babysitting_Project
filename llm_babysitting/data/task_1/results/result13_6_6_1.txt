ChatGPT
Based on the description, you have uploaded two images of a mathematical expression with the request to first compare the two images for any differences and then to calculate the expression given.
Given that I cannot view the images directly, I will rely on your description that the two images are of the same expression and use the provided lattice information to interpret the expression accurately.
The expression provided, as per your text, is:
x=1
∑
10
−8(−1)
x
(cos(
2
πx
)+10)
Now, let's calculate this expression step by step. We need to evaluate the sum for 
x from 1 to 10. Each term in the sum is 
−8 multiplied by 
(−1)
x
 and the quantity 
cos(
2
πx
)+10. The cosine term will oscillate based on the value of 
x, and 
(−1)
x
 will alternate signs for each 
x.
I will now perform this calculation using Python.
The answer is 
8.
