The expression from the images you've uploaded is a summation that can be read as follows:
x=1
∑
10
(x
2
−sin(
2
−5
sin(
2
πx
)π))
This is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the function 
x
2
 minus the sine of 
2
−5
 times the sine of 
π
2
πx
 times 
π.
To calculate this sum, I'll proceed as follows:
Calculate 
x
2
 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
Compute the value of 
sin(
2
πx
).
Multiply the result by 
2
−5
 and then take the sine of the entire expression.
Subtract this value from 
x
2
.
Sum all the calculated values for 
x from 1 to 10.
Let's compute this using Python.
The answer is 
386.0.
