To solve the given expression, we'll follow the mathematical steps for calculating a summation of a trigonometric function. The expression in the image is:
∑
x=1
10
sin
⎝
⎛
2sin(
2
πcos(
6
−π
x)
)
π(π(70x+49))
⎠
⎞
Breaking this down:
Calculate the inner cosine term: 
cos(
6
−π
x).
Compute the sine of half the result of the cosine.
Multiply 
70x+49 by 
π and divide by the sine result from step 2.
Take the sine of the entire fraction.
Sum this expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's perform the calculations step by step using Python.
The answer is approximately 
−4.029.
