The expression you've uploaded is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of half the product of 
π and the sine of 
π times 
2
x
+
2
3
.
The mathematical representation is:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
To calculate this, we would:
Calculate the argument of the sine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10.
Take the sine of this result.
Multiply this by 
π and then divide by 2.
Take the cosine of the result from step 3.
Sum up all these cosine values.
I will calculate this sum using Python. Let's begin the calculation.
The answer is 5.0.
