The expression from the images is a mathematical sum, specifically a sigma notation, which represents a series of terms that are added together. The expression inside the sigma notation seems to be a trigonometric expression involving cosine and sine functions. The overall expression is:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
sin(πx)
)
Now that we have the expression, we will calculate the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of this trigonometric function. Let's proceed with the calculation step by step.
The answer is 
10.
