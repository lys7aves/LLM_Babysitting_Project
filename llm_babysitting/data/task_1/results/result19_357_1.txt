Let's begin by interpreting the mathematical expression depicted in the images. The images display the expression using a sigma notation which suggests a summation, and various sizes of grids which assist in identifying the precise location of each element in the expression.
The standard structure of the expression in the images is as follows:
x=1
∑
10
cos
x
(
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
)
Now, let's calculate the given expression:
This summation involves computing the cosine of a cosine function to the power of 
x, for 
x ranging from 1 to 10. The most efficient way to calculate this is to evaluate the inner cosine for each 
x, raise this result to the power of 
x, and then sum all the results from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's proceed with the calculation using Python.
The answer is 
10.
