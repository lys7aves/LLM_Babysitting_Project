The given expression appears to be a mathematical sum:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
To evaluate this sum, we'll calculate the sine of the cosine term for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then sum these values.
The expression inside the sine function has a cosine term that is itself an angle dependent on 
x. We have to consider the behavior of cosine function. Since 
cos(θ) has a period of 
2π, the cosine of a multiple of 
π will either be 1, 0, or -1, depending on the multiple. Specifically, 
cos(nπ) is 1 for even 
n and -1 for odd 
n.
Given 
π
2
πx
, we can see that it will be 
π times an integer when 
x is even, yielding 
cos(π)=−1 or 
cos(0)=1. When 
x is odd, 
π
2
πx
 will not be a multiple of 
π, and we would need to calculate the cosine value specifically.
Let's calculate the sum step by step using Python.
The answer is approximately 
−1.
