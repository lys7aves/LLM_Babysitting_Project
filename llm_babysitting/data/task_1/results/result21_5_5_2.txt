The OCR has failed to recognize any text from the image. This might happen due to the complexity of mathematical expressions which are not always well-handled by OCR software. I'll now attempt to analyze the equation visually to interpret and calculate it. Let's start by examining the provided images directly. 
The equation from the images is:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
This expression is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of half the product of 
π and the sine of 
π times the quantity 
2
x
+
2
3
.
Now I will calculate the sum of this expression for 
x ranging from 1 to 10. 
The answer is 
5.0.
