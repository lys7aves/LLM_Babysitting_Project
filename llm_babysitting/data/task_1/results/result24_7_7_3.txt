The expression from the images represents a mathematical summation and is written as:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
))
This expression instructs us to sum the sine of a certain function of 
x as 
x ranges from 1 to 10. The function inside the sine involves both cosine and a linear transformation.
To calculate the value of this summation, we will evaluate the function inside the sine for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, take the sine of the result, and then sum all these sine values together. Let's proceed with the calculation using Python.
The answer is 
−5.
