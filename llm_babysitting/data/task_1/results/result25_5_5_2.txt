The two images you have uploaded seem to represent the same mathematical expression, with the second image including a grid overlay for more accurate reading. Let's start by interpreting the expression correctly.
Based on the grid, the expression can be read as follows:
∑
x=1
10
sin
x
(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
This expression is a sum, from 
x=1 to 
x=10, of the sine function raised to the power of 
x, with the argument of the sine function being 
2
π
sin(
2
πx
), all divided by 2.
Let's calculate this expression step by step using Python.
The answer is 
1.0.
