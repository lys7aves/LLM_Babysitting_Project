It seems that the OCR was not able to correctly read the text from the image. Let's try a different approach by examining the image directly to identify and calculate the equation. 
The equation in the image appears to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of a fraction. The numerator is a sine function, and the denominator is also a sine function within another sine function, all multiplied by 
π.
To calculate this, we'll need to manually interpret the equation and then use Python to compute the sum. Let's do this step by step. The equation seems to be:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
sin(x)
Now we'll compute this sum using Python. 
The answer is approximately 
4.3584195256630545×10
15
