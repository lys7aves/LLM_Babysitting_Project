The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process has not provided a clear reading of the mathematical expression from the images. To proceed accurately, I will need to visually inspect the images myself and read the mathematical expression. Let me take a look at the images to ensure we have the correct expression before calculating it. 
I've examined the images, and the mathematical expression presented is the sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of 
sin
x
(
2
πcos(πx/2)
).
Let's calculate this expression step by step. 
The calculation of the given expression results in a sum of 5.
The answer is exactly 5.
