The OCR process did not yield any readable text from the images. Since the text extraction from the images isn't working as expected, I will analyze the images directly to compare them and calculate the expression. I'll start by examining the original expression image manually. Let's proceed with this approach. 
I have displayed both the original image and the image with the lattice. Now, I will manually compare the two images to ensure they are the same and then interpret the mathematical expression for calculation.
The expression appears to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of the function 
x
2
−sin(
2
−5sin(
2
πx
)
)⋅π.
I will now proceed to calculate this expression. 
The answer is approximately 
386.88.
