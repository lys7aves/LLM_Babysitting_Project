The optical character recognition (OCR) did not detect the mathematical expression correctly in either image. This can occur due to the complexity of mathematical notation, which can be challenging for OCR software. To proceed, I'll interpret the expression manually.
Given the nature of the expression, it appears to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of 
x
2
 minus the sine of 
(
(−
2
5
) times the sine of 
π
2
πx
 times 
π. If this interpretation is correct, I will calculate the value of this expression.
The expression to be calculated is:
x=1
∑
10
(x
2
−sin(−
2
5
)sin(
2
πx
)π)
Let's calculate this now. 
The answer is approximately 
386.88.
