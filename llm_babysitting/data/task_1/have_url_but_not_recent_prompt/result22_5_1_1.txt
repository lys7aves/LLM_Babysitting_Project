The OCR has not provided a clear reading of the expressions in the images. It seems that the mathematical notation is complex and not easily interpreted by the OCR software. This is a common issue with recognizing mathematical expressions using OCR, as they often include symbols and structures that OCR is not optimized to handle.
Given the limitation of the OCR output, I will now manually interpret the mathematical expressions from the original images to ensure accuracy. Let's proceed with the manual analysis. 
I have examined the images manually to read the mathematical expressions. Now, let me explain the expression step by step and proceed to calculate it.
The expression is a complex mathematical function involving summation and trigonometric functions. I will first interpret the expression as accurately as possible based on the images provided. Once the expression is clearly defined, I can proceed with the calculation.
Let's begin with the interpretation. I will break down the expression into its components and then combine them to form the full mathematical expression for calculation. Please hold on while I complete this step. 
The images you've provided seem to contain mathematical expressions with various trigonometric functions and a summation notation, enclosed in large parentheses, suggesting a compound fraction or function composition. However, due to the complexity of these expressions and their format, manual inspection is required for precise interpretation.
The OCR results were not accurate, which is often the case with complex mathematical notation. Therefore, I will interpret the expressions based on the manual inspection I've done:
The expression in the images appears to be structured as follows:
(
⎝
⎛
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
−sin(4πsinx)
⎠
⎞
Given the structure of this expression, it involves nested trigonometric functions and might be part of a larger problem, possibly involving integration or evaluation over a range of values for 
x. To proceed with the calculation, we would need to know the context in which this expression is used, such as the limits of the summation if it's part of a series, or the bounds of integration if it's part of an integral.
Unfortunately, without additional context or instructions on how to evaluate this expression (for example, the range of values for 
x if it is a summation), it is not possible to provide a numerical answer.
If you can provide the missing details, such as the limits of summation or the values of 
x to be used, I can then proceed with the calculation.
