To begin, I'll compare the two images to ensure that the mathematical expression is read accurately. Then, I'll proceed to calculate the expression. Let's start by examining the images for any differences that might affect the interpretation of the expression.
The OCR has not been successful in extracting the text accurately from the images. However, given that the images are of a mathematical expression, I will manually interpret the expression from the original image and confirm that the expression with the lattice is the same.
The expression appears to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of the sine of 
π times 
x+
2
3
:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
Next, I will calculate this expression. Since sine is a periodic function with period 
2π, and we are evaluating it at points that are 
π apart, we can predict that the values will repeat or have some symmetry. However, we can calculate the exact value of the summation by evaluating the sine function at each value of 
x from 1 to 10. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The answer is 
0.
