Error analyzing
It seems there was a timeout error while trying to process the images, which can sometimes happen if the image is complex or the text is difficult to extract. Let's try a different approach by examining the expression manually.
Looking at the images you've uploaded, they contain a mathematical expression. Since the OCR attempt timed out, I will manually interpret the expression and then proceed to calculate it. Let me analyze the provided images and read the expression first. 
Upon examining the image, the mathematical expression can be manually read as:
x=1
∑
10
(cos
x
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
)
We will now proceed to calculate this expression. Please note that this interpretation is based on a visual examination of the image. If there are intricacies or nuances in the image that I cannot discern, it might affect the accuracy of the transcription. Let's calculate this expression step by step. 
The answer is 
10.
This result suggests that the summation of the series as given simplifies to the integer 10. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the manual interpretation of the expression from the image is correct. If there are any subtleties in the notation that were not captured in this interpretation, it could lead to a different result.
