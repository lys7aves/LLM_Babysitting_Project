Before calculating the expression, let's first compare the two images to ensure we understand the mathematical expression accurately.
The expression in the images is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of a complex fraction. The numerator of the fraction includes a product and a function, and the denominator is the number 2. It is important to note the parentheses and their respective scopes to interpret the order of operations correctly.
The expression can be interpreted as follows:
x=1
∑
10
2
3πxcos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
π
7cos(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
Now, let's proceed with calculating the expression step by step. We will calculate the innermost part first, which is the cosine of 
π
2
πx
, then move outward, computing the sine and then the cosine of the resulting value, and finally multiply by 
3πx and divide by 2 for each term of the summation from 1 to 10.
The answer is approximately 
163.27.
