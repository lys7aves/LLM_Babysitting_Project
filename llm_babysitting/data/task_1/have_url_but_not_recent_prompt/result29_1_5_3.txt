The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not successfully extract text from the images. This means I'll need to visually inspect the images to interpret the mathematical expression. Since the OCR output is not helpful, I will proceed to analyze the images directly to understand the expression.
Let's start by manually comparing the images to ensure accuracy in reading the expression. I'll carefully observe the expression in both images to identify and correct any potential OCR misinterpretations. After that, I can proceed to calculate the expression. 
I have inspected the images visually. Since the OCR did not extract any text, I will interpret the expression based on my analysis.
The expression appears to be a summation:
x=1
∑
10
sin
⎝
⎛
πcos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
⎠
⎞
Next, I will calculate this expression. 
The calculated sum of the expression is approximately 
1.57×10
−15
.
Given the nature of floating-point arithmetic in computers and the fact that the result is very close to zero, it's reasonable to conclude that the exact mathematical result of the expression is 
0, within the limits of computational precision.
The answer is approximately 
0.
