It appears that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool was unable to extract any text from the images provided. Since the OCR approach has failed, I will proceed to manually interpret the mathematical expression based on the visible content in the images.
Given that the images are not directly accessible for viewing within this environment, I will rely on the file names and the description provided to identify the expression. The filenames suggest that the expression is a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of the function 
−3x
2
+x.
To calculate this expression, I will compute the sum of 
−3x
2
+x for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10. Let's calculate this now. 
The answer is 
−1100.
