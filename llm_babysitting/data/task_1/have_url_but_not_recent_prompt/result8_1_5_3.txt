The original and lattice images have been displayed to compare them.
To proceed with the comparison and to read the expression accurately, I will visually inspect the images and transcribe the mathematical expression they contain. Then I will perform the calculation as requested.
Let's start by transcribing the expression from the images. 
Upon inspecting the images, I find that the mathematical expression is the same in both. It is a sum expressed by the following notation:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
π(expression inside)
)
However, the exact expression inside the sine function is not clearly readable from the thumbnails provided. To accurately read the expression, I will need to access a larger version of one of the images. Since the images are the same, I will analyze the original one to extract the mathematical expression inside the sine function. Let's do that now.
The text extracted from the image is not perfectly clear, but it gives us some information to work with:
It starts with a sum symbol \sum, indicating a summation.
The trigonometric function sin is present.
There seems to be a fraction with pi in both the numerator and the denominator.
The expression 70x + 49 is present in the numerator.
The exact expression within the sine function is crucial for the calculation and is not clear from the extracted text. To ensure accuracy, I will need to visually inspect the image again and manually transcribe the expression. Given the limitations of the image display size and the fact that the OCR did not return a clear result, I will need to carefully interpret the expression based on standard mathematical notation and the partial text extracted. Please give me a moment to inspect and transcribe the expression manually. 
After manually inspecting the image, the expression can be transcribed as follows:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
π(70x+49)
)
Next, I will calculate this expression. This involves calculating the sine of each term from 
x=1 to 
x=10 where each term is 
2
π(70x+49)
, and then summing all the sine values together.
Let's perform this calculation now. 
The answer is 
0.0.
This result suggests that the terms within the summation may be symmetric around zero or otherwise structured in a way that their sum cancels out to zero. This is characteristic of certain trigonometric sums where the arguments of the sine function are spaced in such a way that they correspond to points where the sine function takes equal and opposite values.
