The two images provided show the same mathematical expression with the summation symbol. The second image includes a lattice overlay which can help in precisely locating different parts of the expression, but in this case, it doesn't alter the reading of the expression. The expression given in both images is:
x=1
âˆ‘
10
(x
x
+9)
This is a sum of terms from 
x=1 to 
x=10, where each term is the sum of 
x raised to the power of 
x and the number 9.
Now, I will calculate the value of this expression. 
The answer is 
10405071407.
