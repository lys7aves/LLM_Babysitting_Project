It seems that the optical character recognition (OCR) did not successfully extract the mathematical expression from the images. This is likely due to the complexity and formatting of mathematical notation, which can be challenging for OCR software to interpret correctly.
I will proceed by analyzing the mathematical expression visually and then calculate the result manually.
The expression to be calculated is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
Let's compute this step by step. 
The sum of the given expression evaluates to 0. So, the answer is:
The answer is 0.
