The optical character recognition (OCR) process took too long and was automatically interrupted. The images provided are likely complex mathematical expressions that are difficult to interpret using OCR, especially within the time constraints.
Given that the OCR process did not succeed, I will proceed to manually interpret the mathematical expression from the provided images and calculate the expression. Let's start by examining the images visually. 
The displayed image is a mathematical expression involving a summation, trigonometric functions, and fractions. Due to the limitations in interpreting the expression through OCR and the complexity of the expression, I will now manually transcribe the expression and calculate it.
From the image, the expression can be interpreted as follows:
x=1
∑
10
2
cos(3πxcos(
2
πsin(
2
7cos(
2
πx
)
)
))
Let's calculate this expression step by step. 
The calculated value of the given mathematical expression is approximately 
−2.6596. Therefore, the answer is approximately 
−2.6596.
