The text extracted from the original image is "10 > (—3x^2 + x) a=1", which seems to be a misinterpretation of the symbols by the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. For the lattice image, the OCR did not return meaningful results.
Based on the standard notation for sums, the expression looks like it should be a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the expression 
−3x

+x.
Given this, let's calculate the correct sum:
\sum_{x=1}^{10} (-3x^2 + x)
\] &#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;
The answer is -1100.
