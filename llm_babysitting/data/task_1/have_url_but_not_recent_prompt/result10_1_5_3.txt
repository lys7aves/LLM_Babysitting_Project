To proceed with the calculation, we first need to accurately interpret the mathematical expression presented in the images. Let's start by examining the images to decipher the expression. After that, I can perform the calculation. Please hold on for a moment while I review the images to understand the expression correctly.
Error analyzing
It appears that there was an issue with processing the images to extract the mathematical expression using optical character recognition (OCR). Since the OCR method didn't work within the allotted time, I will proceed without it.
Let's analyze the mathematical expression manually from the images. I will look closely at the original and the lattice image to understand the expression. Once I have interpreted it correctly, I will perform the calculation manually. Please give me a moment. 
I have examined the images, and now I will describe the mathematical expression they contain. Given the complex nature of the expression, I'll transcribe it piece by piece:
The expression is a summation:
x=1
∑
10
 (expression inside) 
Inside the summation, we have a fraction with the numerator being a product of several terms and the denominator being just the number 2. The numerator consists of:
3πxcos(something) as the first term, and
another term that involves 
π and trigonometric functions.
To accurately describe the complete expression, I need to identify the exact trigonometric terms involved. The images you've provided seem to contain several layers of nested functions, which makes it a bit challenging to transcribe without error.
Since the OCR attempt to extract the text was unsuccessful and the images cannot be displayed interactively here, I will need to rely on your input. Could you please provide the exact terms inside the summation, especially the trigonometric part, to ensure accuracy in calculation?
