The OCR process did not successfully extract text from the images. This could be due to the complexity of the mathematical expression. I will manually inspect the images to compare them and read the expression for calculation. Let's begin with examining the original image. 
Upon examining the original image, the expression is a mathematical summation. However, due to the nature of the image and the limitations of this format, I can't directly transcribe complex mathematical formulas with absolute certainty. Nevertheless, I can describe the structure based on the image:
It appears to be a summation (Σ) from x equals 1 to 10 of the sine of x, divided by a nested expression. The nested expression seems to be a product of π (pi) and the sine of another fraction involving π and x.
I will now look at the second image with the lattice, which should help in pinpointing the exact locations of the elements of the expression. This will assist in confirming the structure of the expression. Let's examine the second image now. 
The second image with the lattice confirms the locations of the elements of the expression. The expression to be calculated is the sum from x equals 1 to 10 of:
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
sin(x)
Next, I will calculate this expression. To do so, I'll write a Python function to evaluate the sine function for each integer value of x from 1 to 10, sum the results, and return the final answer. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The answer is approximately
