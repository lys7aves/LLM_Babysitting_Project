The OCR process did not yield a clear transcription of the mathematical expressions from the images. It appears that the text is not being correctly recognized. Since the OCR has failed to provide an accurate result, I will proceed by manually inspecting the images to compare and read the expression correctly before calculating it. Let's first manually compare the two images to understand the expression. 
After manually inspecting the images, the mathematical expression is:
x=1
∑
10
−8(−1)
x
(cos(
2
πx
)+10)
This is a summation expression where 
x takes integer values from 1 to 10. For each value of 
x, the term to be added to the sum is 
−8 multiplied by 
(−1)
x
 and then multiplied by the result of the cosine of 
π
2
πx
 added to 10.
Now, I will calculate the value of this expression. 
The answer is 
8.
