The comparison of the two images indicates that they are not identical. Without identical images, I cannot confidently proceed with the calculation based on the visual information provided. However, if the intention is to calculate the expression from the first image, which appears to represent the mathematical summation expression 
∑
x=1
10
(10+x−2x), we can still perform this calculation mathematically.
The expression simplifies to 
∑
x=1
10
(10−x). Let me calculate this for you now. 
The answer is 45.
