It seems that the text extraction from the images was not successful, which means I'll need to analyze the images directly to compare them and interpret the mathematical expression.
I will visually inspect the images and then proceed with the calculation. Let's start by comparing the images. 
Upon visual inspection, the images display the same mathematical expression, which reads as follows:
x=1
∑
10
(x
2
−sin(
π
(−5)sin(
2
πx
)
))
The lattice lines on the second image are simply to assist in accurately positioning and reading the expression, and do not change the expression itself.
Now, let's proceed with the calculation of this expression. We will calculate the value of this summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10. 
The answer is approximately 
386.
