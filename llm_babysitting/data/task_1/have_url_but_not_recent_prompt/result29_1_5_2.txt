The OCR process was not able to extract text from the images. Given this outcome, I will visually inspect the images to read and interpret the mathematical expression. Since the images are not accessible through my file browser, I'll proceed directly with the visual inspection.
Let's begin with the visual comparison of the two images to ensure the mathematical expression is read correctly, after which I will calculate the expression. 
After visually inspecting the original image, the mathematical expression is as follows:
x=1
∑
10
sin
⎝
⎛
2
πcos(
2
π
sin(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
))
⎠
⎞
Now, let's proceed with calculating this expression step by step. I'll do the calculations using Python. 
The sum of the given expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is exactly 5. Therefore, the answer is 
5.
