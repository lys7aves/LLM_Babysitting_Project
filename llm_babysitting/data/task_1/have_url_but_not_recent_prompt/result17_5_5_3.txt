The OCR has not successfully recognized the mathematical expression in the image. Given that the expression appears to be written using LaTeX-style notation, I will interpret it manually.
The expression in the image seems to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of 
cos of a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is 
sin of 
πx and the denominator is 
2.
To proceed accurately, I will manually transcribe the expression and then compute its value. The correct mathematical expression seems to be:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
sin(πx)
)
Now, let's calculate this expression. 
The answer is 
10.0.
