Error analyzing
It seems that the OCR process to extract the mathematical expression from the images took too long and was automatically interrupted. This may be due to the complexity of the mathematical expressions or the format of the images.
Instead of relying on OCR, I will analyze the images directly to interpret the mathematical expressions they contain. I'll proceed with a manual inspection of the images to determine the correct expression, and then I'll perform the calculation. Let's start by manually inspecting the provided images. 
I have displayed the images for manual inspection. However, as an AI, I don't have the capability to visually inspect or interpret images in the same way a human would. I rely on tools like OCR to extract text from images, which in this case, did not work within the allotted time due to the complexity of the content.
Given this situation, could you please provide the mathematical expression in text form? With the expression, I can proceed to calculate its value.
