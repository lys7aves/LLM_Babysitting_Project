The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) has misinterpreted the mathematical expressions in the images. Since the OCR output is not reliable for complex mathematical expressions, I will directly analyze the images to read the expression.
Given that the expression in both images is the same, I will proceed to manually interpret the mathematical expression from the images, then calculate the expression as requested. Let's begin by interpreting the expression manually. 
The expression to be evaluated, based on the images provided, is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
))
Now, I will calculate this expression.
The answer is -5.0.
