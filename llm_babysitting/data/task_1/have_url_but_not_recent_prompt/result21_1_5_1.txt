The OCR has returned text that does not accurately represent the mathematical expression in the images. Given the complexity of the expression, OCR technology may struggle to correctly interpret mathematical symbols and their arrangement.
To proceed accurately, I will manually interpret the expression from the images, comparing them to ensure I understand the precise positioning of the elements in the expression. Let's attempt to correctly read and then calculate the expression. 
I have reviewed the images, and the mathematical expression is as follows:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
Now, let's proceed with calculating this expression step by step. 
The answer is 
5.0.
