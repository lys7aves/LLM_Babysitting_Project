The OCR has provided some text from the images, but it's incomplete and somewhat inaccurate. It seems that the OCR is not able to correctly interpret the mathematical expressions in the images.
Given this, I'll proceed with analyzing the images directly to read the expressions. I'll start by examining the original image and then use the image with the lattice to verify the precise location of each part of the expression.
Afterwards, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression and perform the calculation.
Let me analyze the images directly to read the expressions. 
The expression shown in the image appears to be a complex mathematical formula involving summation, trigonometric functions, and possibly fractions or integrals. Unfortunately, the direct display of the image here does not enable me to discern the details accurately. The resolution is too low to make out the smaller elements, such as exponents or finer mathematical symbols, and to properly identify the structure of the expression.
To accurately read and interpret the expression, I will now analyze the second image with the lattice. The grid should help pinpoint the exact location of each part of the expression, and it might be easier to read the smaller details. Let's take a look at that image next. 
The lattice image is also displayed at a low resolution which hampers the ability to read and interpret the complex mathematical expression accurately. As with the first image, finer details like exponents, indices, and other mathematical notations are not clearly visible.
Given the limitations of the image display resolution within this interface, I cannot accurately transcribe and calculate the expression. To proceed with the calculation, I would need a higher-resolution image or a clear text-based description of the expression.
If you can provide a higher-resolution version of the image or the expression in text form, I will be able to assist you further with the calculation.
