Error analyzing
It appears there was an issue with processing the images to extract the mathematical expression due to a timeout error. This can sometimes happen with complex images or when the OCR software takes too long to interpret the data.
Given that we are unable to accurately transcribe the image using OCR, we can proceed by manually interpreting the expression based on the provided images. Let's analyze the images directly to understand the expression and calculate it step by step. 
The expression from the image is a summation that can be interpreted as:
x=1
∑
10
cos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(π(
2
x
3
−1))
⎠
⎞
Now, let's calculate this expression step by step. We'll compute the cosine of the given expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and sum the results. 
The answer is exactly 5.0.
