It seems that the optical character recognition (OCR) process was not able to detect any text from the image provided. This could be due to various reasons such as the quality of the image, the format of the text, or the presence of mathematical symbols which OCR may have difficulty interpreting.
Since OCR did not work, I will manually inspect the image and provide an interpretation of the mathematical expression.
Let's proceed with this approach. I will now manually examine the image and interpret the mathematical expression. After that, I can calculate the value of the expression. 
Upon manual inspection, the expression in the image is a summation:
x=1
∑
10
2
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
This is a sum of the function from 
x=1 to 
x=10. To compute this, I will evaluate the sine function inside the summation for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, multiply the result by 
π, take the sine of that result, divide by 2, and then sum all these terms together.
Let's perform this calculation.
The sum of the given expression evaluates to 
π/2, which is approximately 1.5708. Therefore, the answer is 
π/2 or the answer is approximately 1.5708.
