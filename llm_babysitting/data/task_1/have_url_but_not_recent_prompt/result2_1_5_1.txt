It appears that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was unable to extract any text from the images provided. Since I can directly interpret the images, let's proceed with the manual comparison and calculation of the expression.
The provided expression is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
(10+x−2x)
Now I will calculate this expression step by step.
The simplified form of the expression inside the summation is 
10+x−2x which simplifies to 
10−x.
Now we sum 
10−x from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's perform this calculation. 
The answer is 
45.
