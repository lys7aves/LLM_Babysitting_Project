The expression from both images can be read as follows:
x=1
∑
10
(6x(sin(
2
πx
)+10)
8
−8)
This is a summation that runs from 
x=1 to 
x=10, and within the summation, there is a multiplication of 
6x and the eighth power of the sum of 
sin(
2
πx
) and 10, from which 8 is then subtracted.
I will now calculate the value of this summation.
The answer is 
39875102470.
