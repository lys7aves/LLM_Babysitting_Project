The expression depicted in both images is the same. It reads:
∑
x=1
10
(10+x−2
x
)
This is a summation expression where 
x takes on the integer values from 1 to 10. The expression inside the summation is 
10+x−2
x
. To calculate this expression, we will compute the value of 
10+x−2
x
 for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and then sum all those values.
Let's perform the calculation. 
The answer is -1891.
