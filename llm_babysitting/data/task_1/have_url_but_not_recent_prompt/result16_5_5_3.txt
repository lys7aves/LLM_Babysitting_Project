The OCR process did not capture the mathematical expression correctly from the images provided. Since OCR may not always accurately interpret mathematical notation, I'll attempt to read the expression directly from the images myself.
Firstly, I'll examine the structure of the mathematical expression from the original image, and then I will proceed to perform the calculation. Let's start by analyzing the expression visually. 
The expression in the image is a summation, which is mathematically represented as follows:
x=1
∑
10
cos
⎝
⎛
2
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
To calculate this expression, we will evaluate the cosine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, where 
x is also used in the nested sine functions within the argument of the cosine function. I will now compute the value of this expression. 
The answer is 
5.0.
