Let's begin by examining the mathematical expressions in the images you have uploaded.
From the images, it appears we have a complex fraction involving trigonometric functions within a summation. The general form of the expression seems to be:
2
πsin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
This expression is within the summation bounds from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Now, I will calculate this expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, sum the results, and provide you with the final answer.
