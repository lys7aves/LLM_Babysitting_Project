The images have been compared visually. The expression is the same in both images, and the lattice grid does not affect the mathematical content of the expression.
The mathematical expression from the image is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
π(70x+49)
)
The expression within the sine function includes a factor of 
π, which indicates that the sine function will repeat every 
2π units. Given that 
70x+49 will generate different multiples of 
π, the sine of these values will vary.
To compute the sum, we will evaluate the sine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and then add them together. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The answer is 
0.
This result is expected because the sine function is periodic with a period of 
2π, and the input to the sine function in the expression is a multiple of 
π. When the input to the sine function is an odd multiple of 
π/2, the sine function alternates between 
1 and 
−1, which in a sum over an even number of terms will cancel out to 
0.
