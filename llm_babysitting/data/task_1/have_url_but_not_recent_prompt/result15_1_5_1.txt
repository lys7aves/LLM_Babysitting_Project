It appears that the optical character recognition (OCR) was unable to accurately extract the mathematical expression from the images. Since the OCR approach is not yielding results, I will visually inspect the images myself and interpret the mathematical expression for further calculation.
Let's proceed with the visual inspection of the images. 
I have visually inspected the images, and the mathematical expression is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
Now, I will calculate the value of this expression. The sum is taken from 
x=1 to 
x=10, and involves the sine of a cosine function. Let's compute this step by step. 
The calculated sum of the expression is approximately 
−2.14×10
−14
.
Given the small magnitude of this result, which is close to the limit of computational precision, the answer is effectively 
0 within the limits of numerical accuracy of the computation.
So, the answer is approximately 
0.
