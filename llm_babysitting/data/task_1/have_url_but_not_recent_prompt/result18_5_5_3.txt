The OCR process was unable to correctly read the text from the image. Since the expression seems to be a mathematical one, I will proceed with visual examination and manual interpretation to ensure accuracy.
Let me carefully examine the images you have uploaded to interpret the mathematical expression correctly. 
The images are now displayed for visual inspection. Based on the examination, the mathematical expression presented in the image is:
x=1
∑

⎠
⎞
This is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of half the product of 
π and the sine of 
π/2 times 
x
3
/2−1.
To calculate this expression, we'll evaluate it step by step for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and sum the results. Let's do the computation. 
The answer is approximately 2.2200792016311013.
