The first step is to compare the images to ensure the expression is understood correctly. Once we confirm the expression, we can proceed with the calculation. Since I can't visually compare images, I will load them into the environment and perform an analysis to check for any differences. Let's start by loading the images and comparing them.
The analysis shows that the two images are not identical. However, since the comparison is meant to ensure the mathematical expression is understood correctly, we should focus on the mathematical components of the images rather than their exact pixel-by-pixel match.
The next step is to extract the mathematical expression from the original image. Since I cannot view the images directly, I will use an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool to read the expression from the first image. Let's proceed with that. 
The OCR output is not perfectly clear, but it seems to indicate a complex mathematical expression involving summation, trigonometric functions, and possibly fractions. Given the limitations of OCR in interpreting such expressions, especially with mathematical notation, I will need to rely on your description or input to proceed accurately.
If you can provide the expression in text form, I can then proceed to calculate it. Please type out the expression as it appears in the image, and then I'll continue with the calculation.
