Error analyzing
The optical character recognition (OCR) process took too long and was automatically interrupted. This could be due to the complexity or quality of the mathematical expressions in the images.
To proceed with analyzing the mathematical expression, I will manually interpret the equation from the images provided. Let's start by examining the equation closely. 
I will now visually inspect the images and interpret the mathematical expression manually. Once I have the correct expression, I'll proceed with the calculation.
Please hold on while I interpret the expression.
Upon reviewing the provided images, it appears that the mathematical expression is quite complex and involves a summation. Since the OCR attempt was unsuccessful, I'll describe the general approach to solving such an expression:
Identify the Summation: The expression involves a summation from 
x=1 to 
10. This means we will evaluate the expression inside the summation for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and sum the results.
Evaluate the Expression: Inside the summation, there seems to be a complex fraction involving trigonometric functions of 
x, possibly involving sine and cosine functions. The exact expression would need to be evaluated for each 
x.
Sum the Results: After evaluating the expression for each 
x, we would add all these values together to get the final result.
However, without the precise expression, I cannot provide an exact numerical answer. If you can describe the expression or provide a clearer image, I could attempt to solve it again.
