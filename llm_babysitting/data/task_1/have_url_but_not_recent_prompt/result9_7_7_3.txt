I will start by comparing the two images to verify the mathematical expression they represent.
Once the expression is confirmed, I will proceed with calculating its value.
Let's begin by analyzing the images.
It seems that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was not able to read the text from the images correctly, as it returned no meaningful output. Since OCR has failed to recognize the mathematical expression from the images, I will manually inspect the files to determine the correct expression to be calculated. Let me analyze the images and read the expression. 
After inspecting the images, I have confirmed that the mathematical expression is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
Now that we have the correct expression, I will proceed to calculate its value.
The answer is 
0.
This result is expected since 
sin(π⋅(n+
2
1
)) for any integer 
n is always 0, because 
π⋅(n+
2
1
) is an odd multiple of 
π
2
π
, at which point the sine function equals 0.
