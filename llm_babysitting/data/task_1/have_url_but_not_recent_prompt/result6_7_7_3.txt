The OCR has not successfully extracted the mathematical expression from the images. Given that the OCR output is not usable for this purpose, I will proceed to visually inspect the images and manually transcribe the mathematical expression to ensure accuracy before performing the calculation.
Let me inspect the images and transcribe the expression. 
The calculated sum of the expression, assuming it is 
∑
x=1
10
(6x(sin(
2
πx
)+10)
2
−8), is 
33670.
The answer is 
33670.
