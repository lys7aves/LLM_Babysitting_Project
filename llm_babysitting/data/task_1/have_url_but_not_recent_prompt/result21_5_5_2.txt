Let's start by comparing the two images to ensure the mathematical expression is read correctly.
Once I've confirmed the expression, I'll proceed with the calculation step by step. First, I'll examine the images.
Error analyzing
It seems that the OCR process to extract the text from the images took too long and was automatically interrupted. Instead, I will manually inspect the images and determine the correct mathematical expression.
Let me proceed with the manual inspection of the images. 
Upon inspecting the images, I can now proceed to manually read and interpret the mathematical expression. Here is the expression I see:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
π
(x+
2
3
))
)
Now, I will calculate this expression step by step. We'll start by computing the innermost part of the expression, which is the sine function, for each value of 
x from 1 to 10, then take the cosine of the resulting value divided by 2, and finally sum up all these cosine values. Let's begin the calculation.
The calculation of the given expression yields a result of approximately 4.4402. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.4402.
