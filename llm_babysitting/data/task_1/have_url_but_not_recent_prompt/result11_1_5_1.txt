The OCR has not been successful in accurately reading the mathematical expression from the images. The expression in the original image seems to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of a product of 
(10x−50) and 
sin(
2x
6
π
), but the OCR output is not clear.
Given this, I will manually interpret the expression from the images and perform the calculation. The expression appears to be:
∑
x=1
10
(10x−50)sin(
2x
6
π
)
Let's calculate this sum. 
The answer is approximately 
−40.7821860841047.
