The OCR process did not successfully read the mathematical expression from the images. Since the expression cannot be accurately obtained from the images via OCR, I will manually transcribe the expression based on the first image provided and calculate it accordingly.
The mathematical expression from the original image is:
∑
x=1
10
(6x⋅(sin(
2
πx
)+10)
4
−8)
I will now proceed to calculate the value of this expression. 
The answer is 
3,511,270.
