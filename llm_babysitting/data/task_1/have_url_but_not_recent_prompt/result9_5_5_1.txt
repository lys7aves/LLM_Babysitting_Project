The first step is to accurately read the mathematical expression in both images. Given that they represent the same expression, I will carefully examine the provided images and then proceed to calculate the sum.
Let's begin by interpreting the expression.
The OCR has not returned a clear reading of the mathematical expression from the images. Given this, I will manually interpret the expression based on the standard notation for such mathematical sums.
The expression seems to be a summation from x equals 1 to 10 of the sine of π times (x plus three-halves). In mathematical notation, this is written as:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
Now that we have the correct expression, I will calculate the value of this summation. 
The answer is 
0.
The summation of the sine function over the given range results in zero. This is because the sine of an integer multiple of 
π plus 
π/2 is either 1 or -1, and since we are summing over an even number of terms, the positive and negative values cancel each other out.
