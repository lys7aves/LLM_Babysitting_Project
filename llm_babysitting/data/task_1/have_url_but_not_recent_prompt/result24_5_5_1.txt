It seems that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process was unable to extract text from the images provided. This can sometimes happen with mathematical expressions due to their complexity and the symbols used.
Given that the OCR has failed to read the expression, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image to ensure accuracy.
The expression in the image is a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the function 
sin(π(
2
cos(πx/2)
+
2
7
)).
I will now calculate this expression step by step. 
The answer is 
−5.
