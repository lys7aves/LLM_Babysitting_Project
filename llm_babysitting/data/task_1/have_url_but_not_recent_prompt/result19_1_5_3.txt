To address this task, I will begin by examining the mathematical expression given in the images. From what I can discern, the expression is a summation, which is given by:
∑
x=1
10
cos
x
(
2
πx
)
Now, let's evaluate this summation. We know that the cosine function has a period of 
2π, and it has specific values for multiples of 
π
2
π
. Specifically:
cos(
2
π
)=0
cos(π)=−1
cos(
2
3π
)=0
cos(2π)=1
And for any integer 
k, 
cos(
2
(2k+1)π
)=0.
Given that 
cos
x
(0)=1 (for 
x=0) and 
cos
x
(π)=(−1)
x
, we can infer the behavior of the expression within the summation as 
x varies from 1 to 10.
Let's compute the sum by considering the behavior of the cosine function at these values.
The answer is 
5.
