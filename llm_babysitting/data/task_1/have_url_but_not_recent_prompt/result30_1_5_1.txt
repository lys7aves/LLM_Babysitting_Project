The text extraction from the images using OCR did not yield the mathematical expression accurately. This could be due to the complexity of the mathematical notation or the quality of the images.
Given this, I will manually interpret the expression based on the original image content. Let's start by examining the original image to read and understand the mathematical expression. After interpreting the expression correctly, I will proceed to calculate its value. 
The mathematical expression from the image is a summation:
x=1
∑
10
(x
2
−sin((−
2
5
)sin(
2
πx
))π)
To calculate this expression, I will perform the summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10, evaluating the square of 
x and the sine function for each value of 
x. Let's proceed with this calculation. 
The answer is approximately 386.88.
