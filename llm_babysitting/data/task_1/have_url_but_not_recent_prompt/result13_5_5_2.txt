The OCR process did not yield a useful result for interpreting the mathematical expression in the images. This is not unexpected, as OCR can struggle with complex notations and symbols, particularly those used in mathematical expressions.
Since OCR is not effective in this case, I'll proceed to manually interpret the expression based on the image you've provided. Let's start by carefully analyzing the image and then perform the calculation manually. 
Upon visual inspection of the images, the mathematical expression can be accurately interpreted as follows:
x=1
∑
10
−8(−1)
x
(cos(
2
πx
)+10)
Now that we have the correct expression, I will calculate the sum. 
The answer is 
8.
