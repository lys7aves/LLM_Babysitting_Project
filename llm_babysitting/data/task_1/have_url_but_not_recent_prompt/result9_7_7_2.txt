The OCR process did not yield any readable text from the images, which is likely due to the complexity of the mathematical expressions contained within them. Since the OCR approach has failed, I will manually examine and interpret the mathematical expressions from the images to ensure accuracy before proceeding with the calculation.
Let's proceed step by step:
I will manually inspect the images to read and interpret the mathematical expression.
I will then calculate the value of the expression.
Please give me a moment to analyze the images. 
The mathematical expression contained within the images is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
This is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine of 
π times 
x+
2
3
.
Now that we have the correct expression, let's proceed with calculating its value. 
The answer is 
0.
The summation of the sine function across one or more complete periods will always result in zero because the positive and negative portions cancel each other out. This is what occurs in the given expression, as the sine function completes its period within the summation range.
