It seems that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not successfully extract text from the images. However, based on the initial descriptions provided, I understand that we are dealing with mathematical expressions involving a summation.
The first step is to accurately interpret the expressions from the images. Since the OCR did not yield results, I will analyze the images directly. Let's examine the images manually. 
The images have been examined, and the expressions can be interpreted as follows:
The first image contains the summation expression: 
∑
x=1
10
(x+1)
The second image, which has the lattice overlay, appears to contain the same expression. The lattice is typically used to provide precise location information, but in this case, it does not alter the expression itself.
Now that the expressions are clear, the calculation of the expression 
∑
x=1
10
(x+1) will be performed. This is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the expression 
x+1.
To calculate this, we will sum the values of 
x+1 for each integer 
x from 1 to 10. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The calculation of the expression 
∑
x=1
10
(x+1) results in 65.
The answer is 65.
