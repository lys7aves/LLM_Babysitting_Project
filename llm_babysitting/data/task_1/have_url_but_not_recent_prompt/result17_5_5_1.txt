The optical character recognition (OCR) did not produce a reliable output, which is expected given the complexity of mathematical expressions. Given this result, I will now manually transcribe the expression based on the original image and then proceed to calculate it.
From the provided image, the mathematical expression appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
5πx
)
sin(πx)
)
Let's calculate this expression step by step. 
The calculation of the expression results in a sum value of 
10. Therefore, the answer is 
10.
