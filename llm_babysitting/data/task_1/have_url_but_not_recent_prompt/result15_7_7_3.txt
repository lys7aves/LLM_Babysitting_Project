Error analyzing
It seems that the process of extracting text from the images took too long and was automatically interrupted. This can happen when the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process is very resource-intensive or if the image is complex.
Since the direct OCR approach didn't work within the time limit, I will take a different approach. I'll manually transcribe the expression from the original image and then calculate it. Let's start by transcribing the expression. 
The mathematical expression depicted in the images is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
Now, let's calculate this expression.
The answer is 
0.
