The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was unable to correctly read the mathematical expressions from the images. This could be due to the format or quality of the images, or the complexity of the mathematical notation, which can be challenging for OCR software.
Since OCR cannot provide us with the necessary information, I will rely on the standard interpretation of the mathematical expression you provided initially, which is the summation from x equals 1 to 10 of (x + 1).
Now, I will calculate the expression using this interpretation:
\sum_{x=1}^{10} (x + 1)
\] &#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;
The sum of the expression 
∑
x=1
10
(x+1) is 65.
The answer is 65.
