I'll begin by examining the provided images to understand the mathematical expression and then proceed to calculate it.
First, let me analyze the images and interpret the expression correctly. I'll get back to you shortly with the steps and the result.
It appears that the optical character recognition (OCR) software has had difficulty interpreting the complex mathematical expressions in the images, and the output does not provide a clear and complete representation of the expressions.
Given this, I will attempt a manual interpretation based on the visual structure of the expression in the image you uploaded. Please bear with me while I analyze the expression. 
Upon reviewing the images, I will describe the mathematical expression as I interpret it:
The expression seems to be a large fraction, with the numerator comprising several elements. There appears to be a summation notation, which includes a sine function, and also a product of pi (Ï€) and sine. The denominator seems to include a product of two sine functions, one of which includes a cosine function in its argument.
However, due to the complexity of the expression and the limitations of the OCR, I cannot guarantee the accuracy of this interpretation. Therefore, I will not be able to calculate the expression without an exact and clear description.
For an accurate calculation, I would need a text-based version of the expression. If you can provide the expression in written form, I would be able to proceed with the calculation.
