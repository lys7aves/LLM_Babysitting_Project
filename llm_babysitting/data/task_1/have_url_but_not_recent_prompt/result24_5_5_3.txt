The OCR process did not successfully extract the text from the image. Since the mathematical expression seems to be complex, OCR might not be the best approach to recognize it accurately.
I will attempt a different method to interpret the expression visually and then proceed to calculate it. Let's take a closer look at the images to understand the mathematical expression. 
The image with the grid should help us accurately position and read the expression. It appears to be a summation expression, from 
x=1 to 
10, of the sine function applied to a trigonometric expression involving 
π, 
x, and a fraction.
The expression within the sine function seems to be 
π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
).
Now, I will calculate this expression from 
x=1 to 
10. 
The answer is 
−5.
