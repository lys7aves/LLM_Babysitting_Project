The OCR has not successfully extracted the mathematical expression from the images. Since I cannot interpret the expressions directly from the image, I will attempt to manually transcribe the expression based on the image contents.
Let's transcribe the expression from the original image and then proceed to calculate it. I will describe the elements of the formula as I interpret them from the original image.
The expression seems to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is 
cos of a function, and the denominator seems to be 
2. Inside the cosine, there appears to be a 
sin function that takes 
πx as an argument and is multiplied by another 
sin function with 
5
2
5πx
 as its argument.
Now let's attempt to calculate the expression with this interpretation. 
The answer is 
5.
