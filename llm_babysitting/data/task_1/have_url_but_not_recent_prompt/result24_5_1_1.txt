The OCR results are not providing a clear and accurate transcription of the mathematical expression from the images. This often happens with mathematical notation due to its complexity and the limitations of OCR technology in recognizing such symbols.
Given this, I'll visually inspect the image myself to read the expression correctly. Let me analyze the images. 
The images provided appear to contain a mathematical expression that is meant to be calculated. Since the OCR did not yield an accurate result, I will interpret the expression visually myself.
Upon inspection, the expression appears to be:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(cos(
2
πx
)+
2
7
))
Now, I will calculate this expression.
The answer is 
0. This result is expected because the sine function is periodic with a period of 
2π, and all the values within the sum are multiples of 
π, which means the sine of these values will be zero.
