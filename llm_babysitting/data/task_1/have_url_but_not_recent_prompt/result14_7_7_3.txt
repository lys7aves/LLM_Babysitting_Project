It appears that optical character recognition (OCR) on the images did not yield any text. This is likely because the images contain mathematical expressions that OCR has difficulty interpreting, especially since the second image has a lattice overlay which could further complicate text recognition.
Since the OCR approach has not worked, I will manually compare the images based on the provided description. Given that the two images are supposed to contain the same mathematical expression, I will use the description you provided to interpret the expression and calculate it. The expression is a summation:
x=1
âˆ‘
10
(x+x
x
+2)
This means that for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, we calculate the value of 
x+x
x
+2 and then sum all those values together.
Let's proceed to calculate this sum. 
The answer is 10,405,071,392.
