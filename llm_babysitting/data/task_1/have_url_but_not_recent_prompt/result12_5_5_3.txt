It seems that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not successfully extract the mathematical expression from the images. This could be due to the complexity of the mathematical notation or the quality of the images.
Since I cannot directly interpret the images, I will manually analyze the expression you've provided in the text, which is a summation expression:
x=1
∑
10
((−7)
x
−9)
Let's calculate this sum step by step. 
The answer is 247,165,752.
