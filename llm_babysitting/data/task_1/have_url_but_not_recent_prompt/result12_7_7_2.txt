Error analyzing
The process of extracting text from the images took longer than expected and was automatically interrupted. I will attempt the OCR process again with a different configuration to try and extract the mathematical expression from the images. Let's give it another try. 
It seems that the OCR process is unable to accurately extract the text from the images provided. This may be due to the complexity of the mathematical expressions or the quality of the images.
Since OCR isn't yielding results, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression based on the image provided initially. The expression appears to be a summation:
x=1
∑
10
((−7)
x
−9)
This represents the sum of the series where each term is 
(−7)
x
−9 and 
x ranges from 1 to 10.
I will now calculate this sum. 
The answer is 
247,165,752.
