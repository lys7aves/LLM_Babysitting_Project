I see that you've uploaded two images that appear to be of the same mathematical expression, with the second image having a lattice overlaid for precise location information. I will first accurately read the expression from the original image.
Once the expression is interpreted correctly, I'll proceed with the calculation.
Let's start by interpreting the mathematical expression in the first image.
It seems that the OCR has not successfully recognized the mathematical expression in the image. I will visually inspect the expression and interpret it manually to ensure accuracy before proceeding with the calculation.
Let me take a moment to examine the image and then I'll carry out the calculation. 
Upon inspecting the image, the mathematical expression is as follows:
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
This is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the cosine of half the product of pi and the sine of half the product of pi and 
x.
Now, I will calculate this expression step by step. We will sum the cosine of the given expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10. Let's perform this calculation.
The calculation of the given expression results in a sum of 
5.
Therefore, the answer is 
5.
