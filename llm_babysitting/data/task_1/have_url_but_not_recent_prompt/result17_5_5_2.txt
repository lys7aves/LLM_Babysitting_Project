Error analyzing
The process to interpret the mathematical expression from the images took too long and was automatically interrupted. This typically indicates that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process was not able to complete in a reasonable amount of time, which can happen for a variety of reasons such as complex layout, non-standard fonts, or poor image quality.
To proceed, I will attempt a different method to analyze the mathematical expression manually. I will load the images and examine specific sections to determine the mathematical expression accurately. Let's try that now. 
The images have been displayed side by side for manual inspection. The mathematical expression appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
sin(πx)
)
With this expression identified, I will now calculate its value. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The answer is 
10.0.
