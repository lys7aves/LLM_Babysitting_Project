To start the process, let's first compare the images to ensure the mathematical expression is the same in both. Since I can't visually compare the images, I'll rely on your description that they both contain the same expression.
Now, assuming the expression is 
∑
x=1
10
(x+x
x
+2), we can calculate this by substituting values of 
x from 1 to 10 into the equation and summing the results.
Let's proceed with the calculation.
The sum of the expression 
∑
x=1
10
(x+x
x
+2) is 
10,405,071,392.
The answer is 
10,405,071,392.
