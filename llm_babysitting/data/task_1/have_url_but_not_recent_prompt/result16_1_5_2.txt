Let's start by examining the two images to understand the mathematical expression they represent. We need to make sure we correctly interpret the symbols and the structure of the expression before proceeding with the calculation.
First, I'll describe the expression based on the images provided. Then, I'll perform the calculation step by step.
Let me analyze the expression now.
The optical character recognition (OCR) on the images did not yield the full mathematical expression, providing only a fragment from one of them. Therefore, I will manually interpret the expression from the images provided.
From the visual inspection of the images, the mathematical expression appears to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of the cosine of a fraction, where the numerator is 
πsin(
2
πx
) and the denominator is 
2.
So the express
