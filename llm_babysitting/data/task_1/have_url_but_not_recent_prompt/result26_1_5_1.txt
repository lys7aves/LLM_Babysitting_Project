The text extracted from the images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is not clear and accurate enough to read the mathematical expression. Since the OCR output is not reliable in this case, I will manually inspect the images to read and interpret the expression.
Based on the visual inspection of the images, the mathematical expression is:
x=1
∑
10
(x+sin
4
(
2
πx
))
Now, I will calculate the value of this expression. 
The answer is 60.
