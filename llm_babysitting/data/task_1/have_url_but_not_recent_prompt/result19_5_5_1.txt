To address the problem you've presented, let's follow the steps you outlined:
Compare the two images to ensure the mathematical expression is understood correctly.
Calculate the expression accordingly.
First, I'll compare the original image and the image with the lattice overlay to confirm the accuracy of the mathematical expression. Once I've verified the expression, I'll proceed to calculate it.
Let's begin with the comparison of the two images. I'll examine the original image and interpret the mathematical expression, then check the second image to confirm the details of the expression. After that, I will perform the calculation.
Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue with interpreting the mathematical expression using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), as the process took too long and was automatically interrupted.
Since OCR has failed, I will proceed with analyzing the images directly to read and then calculate the expression. The expression appears to be a summation involving trigonometric functions, so I will visually inspect the images and write down the formula before attempting to calculate it.
Let's proceed with the visual inspection. 
Upon closer inspection of the images you've provided, it's clear that the mathematical expression involves a summation of cosine terms raised to a power that varies with the index of summation.
The general form of the series seems to be:
∑
x=1
10
cos
x
(
2
πxcos(
2
πx
)
)
With this interpretation, we can proceed to calculate the value of this series. Calculating this expression will involve computing the cosine of an angle, raising it to a power, and then summing these terms from 1 to 10. Given the complexity and potential for floating-point arithmetic issues, this calculation is best performed with a computational tool like Python.
I will now calculate the expression.
The answer is 
10.0.
