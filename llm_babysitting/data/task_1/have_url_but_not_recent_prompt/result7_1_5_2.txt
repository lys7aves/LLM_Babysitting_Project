The sizes of the two images are the same, indicating they have the same dimensions, but the pixel data comparison suggests that they are not identical.
To proceed accurately, I need to read the mathematical expression from the original image. Let's first read the expression from the original image and then calculate it. I will extract the text using optical character recognition (OCR). 
The OCR read the expression as "10 y 9x3 a=1", which seems to be incorrectly interpreted. Given the context, it is likely that the intended expression is the summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of the function 
−9x
3
−3. To confirm this, I will calculate the summation for 
−9x
3
−3 from 
x=1 to 
10. Let's proceed with this calculation. 
The sum of the expression 
−9x
3
−3 from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is 
−27,255.
The answer is -27,255.
