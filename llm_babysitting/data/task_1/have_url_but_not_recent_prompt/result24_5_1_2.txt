It seems that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not successfully extract text from the images. Since I can directly interpret images containing mathematical expressions, I will visually analyze the images to read the expression.
Let's proceed with the analysis and calculation of the expression. I'll start by examining the original image file. 
The mathematical expression from the original image can be read as:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
π
(cos(
2
πx
)+
2
7
))
Now, let's proceed to calculate this expression. Since it's a finite sum, we will compute the sine of the given expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then sum the results. 
The answer is approximately 
−4.24.
