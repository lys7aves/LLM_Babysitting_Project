The OCR process took longer than expected and was automatically interrupted. This means I couldn't extract the mathematical expression from the images provided. To proceed with the calculation, I'll need to manually examine the images and transcribe the mathematical expression.
Let me take a closer look at the images and attempt to manually transcribe the expression for calculation. 
I've displayed the images, but as an AI, I don't have the capability to visually inspect images or their content. Therefore, I cannot directly transcribe or interpret the content of these images. However, I can guide you through the process of how you can solve the expression once you transcribe it manually.
Here's how you can proceed with solving the expression:
Transcribe the Expression: Carefully write down the mathematical expression as text, making sure to note any summations, integrals, fractions, exponents, and other mathematical operations.
Identify Components: Break down the expression into individual components that can be calculated separately.
Simplify: Apply mathematical rules to simplify each component. This may include simplifying fractions, factoring expressions, or using trigonometric identities.
Calculate: Perform the calculations for each simplified component.
Combine Results: If the expression is a sum, difference, product, or quotient of multiple components, combine the results according to these operations.
Finalize: Arrive at the final answer and, if necessary, round it to the desired number of significant figures or decimal places.
Please transcribe the expression from the images, and I can assist you with the calculation.
