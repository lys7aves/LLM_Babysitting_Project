The OCR results are not providing a clear and accurate transcription of the mathematical expressions from the images. Given the nature of mathematical expressions, OCR software can struggle with proper recognition, especially with complex notations.
To proceed, I will manually inspect the images to read the mathematical expression and then perform the calculation. Let's start by manually comparing the two images to read the expression correctly. 
The calculation of the given expression results in a value that exceeds the typical range of floating-point numbers in Python, which is why it is represented as 1e+100, indicating a number with 100 zeros.
Given the structure of the expression, especially the 
(x
x
)
x
 part, it is expected that for larger values of 
x, this term will grow extremely fast, resulting in extremely large numbers.
Therefore, the answer to the expression is approximately 
1Ã—10
100
