Error analyzing
It seems there was an error in processing the images, possibly due to the complexity or nature of the content. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) may not always be reliable for reading mathematical expressions, especially when they are as complex as the ones you've provided. However, we can try a different approach to interpret and calculate the expression manually.
Please give me a moment to examine the images and attempt to interpret the mathematical expression within them. I'll provide you with the correct reading of the expression and proceed with the calculation. 
The images have been displayed, but as an AI, I'm unable to visually inspect them. However, I can provide you with a method to manually interpret the expression based on the structure observed in the lattice image.
The lattice structure is often used to help locate specific parts of the expression, and it seems like you've added it for precision. If the lattice is evenly spaced, it might help to identify where each part of the expression is located and ensure no components are missed or misinterpreted.
Here's a suggested approach for you to interpret the expression manually:
Identify the Main Components: Look for the main mathematical symbols and their respective positions, such as the summation symbol, fractions, trigonometric functions, etc.
Break Down the Expression: Divide the expression into smaller parts and interpret each one. For instance, if there is a fraction, determine the numerator and denominator separately.
Check for Consistency: Use the lattice to ensure that each symbol is consistently placed throughout the expression.
Write Down the Expression: As you identify each part, write it down sequentially to form the complete mathematical expression.
Review: Double-check the written expression to make sure it matches the one in the image.
If you can provide the correct expression based on your manual interpretation, I can then proceed to calculate it for you. Please share the mathematical expression as you read it.
