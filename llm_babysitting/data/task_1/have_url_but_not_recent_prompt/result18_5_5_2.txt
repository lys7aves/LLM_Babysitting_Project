The OCR has failed to accurately read the mathematical expression from the images. Since I cannot visually inspect images, I will proceed by attempting to interpret the expression based on the typical structure of such expressions.
The expression seems to be a summation, which is generally denoted by the symbol \(\sum\) followed by an expression involving a variable, which in this case appears to be 
x. The limits of the summation are typically above and below the \(\sum\) symbol, commonly starting from 1 to a higher number, which could be 10 based on the file names.
The body of the summation seems to involve the cosine function, which is denoted as cos, and inside it, there is a product of 
π and the sine function, denoted as sin. The argument of the sine function appears to be another expression, which could be 
2
x
3
−1, again based on the file names.
If we assume that the expression to be evaluated is:
x=1
∑
10
cos(πsin(
2
x
3
−1))
I will proceed to calculate this expression. 
The answer is approximately 
0.5697.
