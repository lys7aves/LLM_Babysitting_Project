The OCR process has not successfully extracted the mathematical expression from the images. Given that the images contain the same mathematical expression and the lattice is intended for precise location information, I will proceed with interpreting the expression visually to ensure accuracy.
The expression appears to be a summation, and I will now manually transcribe it to confirm:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
Next, I will calculate the value of this expression. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The answer is 
0.
