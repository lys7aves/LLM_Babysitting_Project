The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) did not provide a clear transcription of the mathematical expression from the images. However, based on the images you've uploaded, I will manually interpret the expression and proceed with the calculation.
The expression seems to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the following term: 
−8(−1)
x
(cos(
2
πx
)+10).
Now I will calculate this summation. 
The answer is 
8.
