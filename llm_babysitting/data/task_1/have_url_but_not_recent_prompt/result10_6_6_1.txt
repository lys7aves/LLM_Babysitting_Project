Error analyzing
The process of reading the mathematical expression from the image using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) took too long and was automatically interrupted. OCR can sometimes take a long time to process complex images with text like mathematical expressions, especially if the text is not clear or if the image contains a lot of noise.
Since the OCR method was not successful, I'll attempt another approach to compare the images and calculate the expression. Let's try a different method to analyze the images. 
The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between the two images is approximately 0.829. This value ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates identical images. The SSIM of about 0.829 suggests that the images are quite similar, but there are some differences. This could be due to the grid lines added in the second image or minor variations in the rendering of the mathematical expressions.
Since the images are not identical, the next step is to interpret the mathematical expression visually, as the OCR approach was not successful. I'll examine the original image, interpret the mathematical expression manually, and then proceed to calculate it. 
I have examined the original image. The mathematical expression is complex and involves summation, trigonometric functions, and fractions. To calculate this expression, we need to correctly interpret all parts of the expression and then evaluate it step by step.
Based on the visual inspection of the image, the expression can be interpreted as a sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of a fraction with the following components:
The numerator is a product of 
3πx and the cosine of a fraction which has:
πsin of a fraction whose numerator is the cosine of 
π
2
πx
 and whose denominator is 
π.
The denominator of the inner fraction is 2.
The denominator is 2.
Now that we have a description of the expression, the next step is to translate this interpretation into a mathematical formula and calculate it. Let's proceed with this calculation. 
The calculated sum of the expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is approximately 242.440. Therefore, the answer is approximately 242.440.
