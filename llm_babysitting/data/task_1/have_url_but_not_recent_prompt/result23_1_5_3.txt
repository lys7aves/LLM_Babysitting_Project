It seems that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was unable to accurately extract the text from the images. Since I cannot visually inspect the images, I will proceed to analyze and calculate the expression based on the typical interpretation of such notation.
The expression provided appears to be a sum from x equals 1 to 10 of the terms 
(x
1/x
5
+(x
x
)
x
).
To compute this expression, I will write a Python function that calculates each term of the sum for x from 1 to 10, and then add up all these terms to get the final result. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The calculated sum of the expression over the range from 1 to 10 is 
1×10
100
, which is an extremely large number. It's important to note that this result is approximate, as calculations involving large exponents can lead to significant numerical errors in floating-point arithmetic.
The answer is approximately 
1×10
100
.
