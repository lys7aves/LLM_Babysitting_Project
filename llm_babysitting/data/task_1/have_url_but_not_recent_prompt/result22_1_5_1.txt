The text extracted from the images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is not very clear and seems to have inaccuracies. However, it does give us some information. The expression appears to involve a summation from x equals 1 to 10 of a sine function, and there's mention of "47 sin", which might indicate multiplication by 4π sin. The OCR has not captured the expression inside the summation correctly.
Given the inaccuracy of OCR and the complexity of mathematical expressions, OCR may not be the best tool for this task. Instead, I will attempt to manually interpret the expression from the image you've provided. Let's take a closer look at the images and then proceed with the calculation step by step. 
The regions between the red lines have been extracted from the lattice image, and there are three distinct regions identified. This means we can isolate parts of the mathematical expression based on these regions for a more precise reading.
Now, let's visualize these regions to ensure they correspond to different parts of the mathematical expression, which will help us to understand the structure of the expression better. 
The images of the three regions extracted between the red lines show different parts of the mathematical expression. The regions appear to be:
Region 1: Shows the beginning of the expression which seems to include 
π and sine functions.
Region 2: Shows a fraction with 
πsin in the numerator.
Region 3: Displays a complex fraction involving 
πcos and possibly an angle or another trigonometric function in the numerator, with 2 as the denominator of the main fraction.
Based on the images, we can infer that the mathematical expression might be composed of a series or a combination of these trigonometric functions. However, without clearer images or a more precise OCR output, it's challenging to identify the exact expression.
To proceed, I'll need to manually transcribe the expression based on these images. Once we have the correct expression, we can then calculate its value. Let's start by interpreting the expression from Region 1 to Region 3. 
Unfortunately, due to the limitation of my current environment, I am unable to manually transcribe or interpret the expression directly from the images. However, if you could provide the correct mathematical expression in text form, I could certainly help with calculating its value.
If you can describe or write out the expression, we can proceed with the calculation step by step.
