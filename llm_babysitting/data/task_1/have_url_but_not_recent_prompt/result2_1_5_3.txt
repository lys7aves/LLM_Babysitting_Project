The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not yield any text from the images. This sometimes happens with mathematical expressions or when the image quality or format is not optimal for text recognition.
However, I can analyze the mathematical expression directly. The original expression you provided is a summation:
∑
x=1
10
(10+x−2x)
To calculate the value of this expression, we can simplify the terms inside the summation and then compute the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Let's do this calculation step by step. 
The result of the expression 
∑
x=1
10
(10+x−2x) is 
45.
The answer is 45.
