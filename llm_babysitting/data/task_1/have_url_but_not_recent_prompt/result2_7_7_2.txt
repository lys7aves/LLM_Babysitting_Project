The OCR process did not successfully extract text from the images provided. This can happen if the image quality is low, the text is too stylized, or the OCR software struggles with the mathematical notation.
Given this, I will manually inspect the images to compare them and read the expression.
Since I cannot directly view the images, I'll assume the expression you've provided is correct based on the text representation you've given, which is:
x=1
∑
10
(10+x−2x)
This simplifies to:
x=1
∑
10
(10−x)
I will now calculate the sum of this expression. 
The answer is 45.
