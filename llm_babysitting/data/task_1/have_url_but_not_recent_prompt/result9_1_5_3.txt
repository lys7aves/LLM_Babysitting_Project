It seems that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was unable to extract the text from the images. However, since I can view the images directly, I'll proceed by interpreting the expression visually.
The expression in the images is a mathematical sum, and it reads:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(x+
2
3
))
To calculate this expression, I will evaluate the sine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, where 
x is an argument of the sine function multiplied by 
π and increased by 
3
2
3π
. The sine of any integer multiple of 
π is 0, and since 
3
2
3π
 is an odd multiple of 
π
2
π
, the values will be either 1 or -1. I will compute this sum programmatically. 
The sum of the given expression evaluates to 0.
Therefore, the answer is 
0.
