It appears that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process was unable to correctly interpret the mathematical expressions from the images. This sometimes happens with complex notation or when the image quality is not optimal for text recognition.
Since the OCR approach did not yield a result, I will analyze the images directly to read and compare the mathematical expressions. Let's start by examining the content of the original image. 
The expression in the original image is a mathematical sum, which is defined as:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
))
This expression is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the sine of a function of 
x. The function inside the sine is 
π times the sum of half the cosine of 
π
2
πx
 and 
7
2
7
.
Now, let's examine the lattice image to confirm if there are any differences in the expression. 
The lattice image appears to be identical to the original image, with the same mathematical expression:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
))
There are no differences in the expression. Now that we have confirmed the expression is the same in both images, let's proceed to calculate its value. 
The answer is 
−5.
