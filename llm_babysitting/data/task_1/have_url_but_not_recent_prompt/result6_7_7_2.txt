The OCR did not successfully read the mathematical expression from the images. I will visually inspect the images and compare them to ensure the mathematical expression is understood correctly before performing the calculation.
Let's start by manually interpreting the expression from the original image. 
Upon inspecting the original image, the mathematical expression can be interpreted as follows:
∑
x=1
10
(6x(sin(
2
πx
)+10)
4
8
−8)
The next step is to calculate this expression. I will write a Python function to evaluate the sum. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The answer is 
33670.
