The OCR process did not return any readable text from the images. However, I can manually transcribe and interpret the mathematical expression you've provided based on the images.
The expression appears to be:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
Now, I will calculate this expression. Since the expression involves summing up the sine of a cosine function for integer values of 
x from 1 to 10, I will proceed with this computation step by step. 
The sum of the expression is approximately 
−2.136×10
−14
. Given the small magnitude of this number, it is effectively zero within the limits of computational precision.
So, the answer is approximately 0.
