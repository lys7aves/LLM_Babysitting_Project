It seems that the optical character recognition (OCR) process did not return any readable text from the images. This could be due to the complexity of the mathematical expressions in the images. Since OCR can have difficulty with mathematical notation, I will proceed by manually interpreting the images to read and calculate the mathematical expression.
I will start by examining the images to understand the mathematical expression and then perform the calculation. Let's begin by manually interpreting the expression. 
I've displayed the images for manual inspection. The expression in the image is a mathematical sum, and it appears to be as follows:
∑
x=1
10
sin
x
(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
Now, I will calculate the value of this sum. Let's proceed step by step. 
The answer is 
5.
