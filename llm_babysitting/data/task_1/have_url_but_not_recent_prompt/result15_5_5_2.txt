The expression in the images is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
This is a summation where 
x takes on integer values from 1 to 10. The function inside the summation is the sine of half the product of 
π and the cosine of 
π times 
x plus 
5/2. To calculate this expression, we need to evaluate the sine function for each value of 
x from 1 to 10, and then sum all these values.
Let's calculate this step by step.
The answer is 
0. This result makes sense because the cosine function is periodic with a period of 
2π, and within one period, it will take on values that are symmetric about the origin. The sine function applied to these values will also be symmetric about the origin, resulting in positive and negative values that cancel each other out when summed.
