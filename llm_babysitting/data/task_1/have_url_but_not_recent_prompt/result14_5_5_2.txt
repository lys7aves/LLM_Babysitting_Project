The extracted text from the original image appears to be "10 > (a +2" + 2) a=1", and from the image with the lattice, it seems to be "10. wo te >| Car |r ar 2) | t=". Both extractions are not correct, which is likely due to the poor OCR (Optical Character Recognition) performance on the mathematical expressions in the images.
Given that OCR has failed to provide an accurate reading of the expression, I will assume the expression to be the summation commonly used in mathematics:
âˆ‘
x=1
10
(x+x
x
+2)
If this is correct, I will proceed to calculate this expression. Let's compute the sum. 
The answer is 10,405,071,392.
