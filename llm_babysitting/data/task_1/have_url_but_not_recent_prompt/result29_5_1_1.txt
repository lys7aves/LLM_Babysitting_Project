To begin, let's carefully compare the two images you've provided to accurately read the mathematical expression they depict. Then, I'll proceed to calculate the expression.
I will compare the images and extract the mathematical expression for calculation. Let's start with that.
It seems that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software could not extract the text from the images. This often happens with mathematical expressions or symbols that are not typical text characters.
Since the automated OCR method did not work, I will interpret the expression manually by examining the images.
I will open the images and analyze the mathematical expression directly. Let's take a look at the original image first. 
I have the original image open now. Given the nature of the task, I will now interpret the mathematical expression contained within the image.
The expression appears to be a sum from x equals 1 to 10 of a fraction. The numerator is a product of pi and cosine of pi times sine of x over 2, and the denominator is 2.
Now, let me look at the image with the lattice to confirm the precise location of each part of the expression. 
With the lattice image reviewed, I can confirm the expression is:
x=1
∑
10
2
πcos(πsin(
2
πx
))
Let's calculate this expression step by step. We will compute the sum for 
x from 1 to 10 of the given function. 
The answer is 
0.
This result is interesting; it implies that the sum of the function over the specified range results in a cancellation effect, leading to a zero sum. This can occur with oscillating functions like sine and cosine, especially when they are used in combination and summed over a symmetrical range.
