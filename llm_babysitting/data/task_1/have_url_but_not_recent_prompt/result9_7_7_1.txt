It appears that the OCR process was unable to accurately read the mathematical expressions from the images. Since the OCR did not yield the required expression, I will proceed with the visual comparison myself.
I will compare the two images visually and then calculate the expression provided. Let's start by carefully examining the original image. 
The expression is the sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of 
sin(π(x+
2
3
)).
Now that we have the correct expression, we can proceed to calculate the sum. Since the sine function is periodic with period 
2π, and the argument of the sine function increases by 
π with each increment of 
x, the sine values will repeat after every two terms. However, since we have an additional 
3
2
3
π added to each 
x, this will shift the values such that the sine function will evaluate to zero for all integer values of 
x, because 
sin(nπ+
2
3
π)=sin((n+
2
3
)π)=0 for any integer 
n.
Thus, without explicit calculation, we can infer that the sum is zero.
The answer is 
0.
