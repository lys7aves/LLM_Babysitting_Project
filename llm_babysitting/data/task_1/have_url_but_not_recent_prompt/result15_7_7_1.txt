It appears that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not yield any text from the images. This is likely due to the complex nature of mathematical expressions, which can be difficult for OCR software to interpret correctly, especially when the expression contains symbols and notations specific to mathematics.
Since the OCR was unable to read the expressions, I will attempt to interpret the expression visually and perform the calculation manually. Let's start by examining the expression from the original image you uploaded. 
The mathematical expression from the original image is as follows:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
Now, I will calculate the value of this expression step by step. This involves computing the cosine for each value of 
x from 1 to 10, then taking the sine of half the product of 
π and these cosines. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The answer is approximately 
−2.14×10
−14
.
Given the very small magnitude of the result, it's effectively 
0 within the limits of numerical precision for floating-point calculations. This is expected for certain symmetrical functions or when dealing with trigonometric functions that may have cancelling effects over a period.
