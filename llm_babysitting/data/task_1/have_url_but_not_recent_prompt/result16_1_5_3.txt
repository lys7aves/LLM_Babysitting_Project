The text extracted from the images is not providing a coherent mathematical expression, likely due to the complexity of the notation and the limits of the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. However, based on the structure of the mathematical expression, we can infer that it's a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of the cosine of some function of 
x.
The function inside the cosine seems to involve 
π and the sine function, but the exact details are not clear from the OCR output. Since the OCR did not return a usable result, I will attempt to interpret the expression manually by looking at the images. 
The expression appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
This is the sum of the cosine of half the product of 
π and the sine of 
πx divided by 2, from 
x=1 to 
10.
Now, let's proceed to calculate this expression. 
The answer is 
5.0.
