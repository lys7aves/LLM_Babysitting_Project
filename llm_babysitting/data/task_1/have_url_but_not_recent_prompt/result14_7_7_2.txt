The expression in both images is:
âˆ‘
x=1
10
(x+x
x
+2)
This is a summation for 
x starting at 1 and going to 10, and for each value of 
x, we add together 
x, 
x raised to the power of 
x, and 2.
To calculate this, we can write a Python function that computes the sum of this expression for each value of 
x from 1 to 10. Let's do this calculation now. 
The answer is 
10,405,071,392.
