The images have been loaded and displayed side by side. The original image and the lattice image appear to show the same mathematical expression. The lattice is used for accurate positioning, but it does not change the content of the expression itself.
The mathematical expression depicted in both images is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
5
))
)
Now, I will calculate this expression. 
The answer is approximately 
−2.14×10
−14
.
Given the nature of the sine function and the presence of 
π in the argument, this result is effectively zero within the precision of floating-point arithmetic used in the calculation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the summation of the given expression is 
0 when considering the limits of numerical precision in computation.
