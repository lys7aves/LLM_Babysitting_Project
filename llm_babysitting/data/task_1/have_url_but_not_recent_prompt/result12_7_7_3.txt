The expression from both images reads the same:
x=1
∑
10
((−7)
x
−9)
This is a summation expression where 
x takes on the values from 1 to 10. For each value of 
x, we compute 
(−7)
x
−9 and then sum up all these computed values.
Now I will calculate the sum of this expression. 
The answer is 247,165,752.
