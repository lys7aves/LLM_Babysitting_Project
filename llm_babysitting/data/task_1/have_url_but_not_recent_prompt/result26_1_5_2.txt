The two images show the mathematical expression:
x=1
∑
10
(x+sin
4
(
2
πx
))
Now, let's calculate the value of this expression. To do this, we'll write a Python function that computes the sine to the fourth power of 
πx/2 for each 
x from 1 to 10, adds 
x to it, and then sums the results. 
The answer is 60.0.
