The text extracted from the original image is partially recognized as ") cos\n\nx=1\n\nsin (a\nTX\n\nresin (\n\n)", while the text from the image with the lattice is not recognized at all.
The recognition quality is poor and does not provide the full mathematical expression. To proceed with the calculation, I'll need to manually interpret the mathematical expression from the original image. Let's analyze the original image again to interpret the expression correctly. 
The OCR results have improved slightly after preprocessing the images, but they are still not entirely accurate. The recognized text from the preprocessed original image is "Same\n\n| asin ( age\n10 sin | ——j—+\nTE\n\nS° cos a\n\nz=1\n", which hints at a sum involving trigonometric functions but is still incomplete and not fully correct.
Given the limitations of the OCR process with these particular images, I will proceed by manually interpreting the mathematical expression based on what I can discern from the images. Let's perform this manual interpretation step by step. 
It seems that the OCR is not able to correctly interpret the mathematical expression from the images provided. In order to proceed, I will manually interpret the expression based on the visual information from the original image.
The expression appears to be a sum from 1 to 10 of a cosine function, which includes a fraction involving sine functions. Unfortunately, without a clearer image or a more accurate OCR reading, it's not possible to determine the exact expression. If you could provide a clearer image or describe the mathematical expression, I can then calculate the expression for you.
