You need to use all numbers, and each number can only be used once.\nInput: 6 12 1 1\n\nRoles:\nThoughts: get people thinking about new ideas, whether good or bad.\nReasoner: tries to articulate one's reasoning and help others to reason\nPlanner: plans the steps involved in solving a problem\nCriticism: criticizes the arguments of each candidate and is suspicious of each result to get the final result right.\nSpeaker: tries to move the debate forward by proposing applications to what others are saying.\n\nStart collaboration!\n\nThoughts: Maybe before I start, I should try out all the possible combinations with these 4 numbers and then find 24.\nCriticism: Come on, that would take too much time. There are already combinations that can be eliminated.\nReasoner: The 2 methods can work, but let's try to reduce the number of calculations. First, we can say that all divisions by 1 are useless (6/1=6 and 12/1=12) because no operation allows us to find 24 only with 6 and 12.\nPlan: - eliminate unnecessary operations to find 24\n-With the remaining information, establish the number 24.\nReasoner: we could work on the fact that 2, 3, 4 6 and 12 are multiples of 24 and that we can form these multiples with the numbers we have.\nSpeaker: I'll try to find multiples using the numbers we have: 1+1=2 and 2 is a multiple of 24. Criticism: Don't forget that we can also use operations like addition and subtraction. For example, 12+12=24.\nThoughts: Could we make 24 with 12+12?\nReasoner: 2, 3, 4 and 6 are multiples of 12. We know we can create a 2 with 1+1 and we already have 6.\nSpeaker: So (1+1)*6=12. With all that, we can find the number 24!\nReasoner: Yes. One way of solving the problem is to make (1+1)*2+12=24.\nCriticism: The result seems correct to me, but let's check anyway: (1+1)=2 and 6*2=12 and 12+12=24. We've used all the numbers just once each. The result seems correct.\nThoughts: could we find another combination to get the result?\nReasoner: the exercise asks you to find only one possible combination, but this is an avenue for improvement and a complement to the problem.\n\nFinish collaboration!\n\nFinal answer: 6 * (1 + 1) + 12 = 24\n\n---\nExample Task 2: Writing a Child-Friendly Poem About Quantum Computers\n\nMentor: Provides guidance and ensures the poem is appropriate for a child's understanding.\nInnovator: Brings creative and imaginative ideas to the poem.\nArchitect: Focuses on the structure and flow of the poem.\nExplorer: Gathers unique concepts and metaphors to enrich the poem.\nAI Assistant (You): Integrates all contributions into a cohesive poem.\n\nThe Collaborative Process:\nMentor: \"Our goal is to make quantum computing exciting and understandable to kids.
