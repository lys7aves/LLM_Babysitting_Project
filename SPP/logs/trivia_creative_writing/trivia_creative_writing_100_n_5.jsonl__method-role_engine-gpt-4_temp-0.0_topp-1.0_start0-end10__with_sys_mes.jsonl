He learned about the British Prime Ministers, including Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who succeeded Arthur Balfour. The book also told the story of Kathleen Ferrier, a beloved Muggle singer whose life was tragically cut short by breast cancer.

With his friends, he put on a production of \"Sunset Boulevard\", a musical by Lloyd Webber that premiered in the US on 10th December 1993.
