It seems there was an internal error when trying to calculate the summation. I'll try the calculation again.

I apologize, but there seems to be a persistent issue with executing the calculation. However, I can still provide you with the LaTeX syntax for the expression. Let's proceed with that.
The LaTeX syntax for the given expression is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos\left((-10)^{\cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)} \pi\right)
Unfortunately, due to the technical issue, I cannot provide the numerical answer at this time. You could use a computational software like MATLAB, Python, or Mathematica to calculate the precise numerical result. If you have access to any of these tools, I can guide you on how to input the expression there.
