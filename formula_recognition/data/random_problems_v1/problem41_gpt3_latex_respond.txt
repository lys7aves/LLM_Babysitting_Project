It appears there is an issue with executing the code at the moment. I will attempt again to solve the expression and provide you with both the LaTeX syntax and the numerical answer. Let's try this once more.

I apologize, but it seems that there is a persistent issue with executing the code to solve the mathematical expression and convert it to LaTeX syntax. Normally, I would calculate the sum of the given expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 and provide the LaTeX syntax for the expression. However, under the current circumstances, I'm unable to perform this calculation directly.
If you have access to a mathematical software or a LaTeX editor, you could manually input the LaTeX code for the expression, which would be:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( \cos\left(\frac{\pi \cos^x\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right) + 9 \right)^x
To solve this, you would typically use a symbolic computation tool such as SymPy in Python or a specialized mathematics software like Mathematica or MATLAB. If you can describe the steps you'd like to follow or need further assistance with the LaTeX syntax or the logic of the calculation, I would be glad to help with that.
