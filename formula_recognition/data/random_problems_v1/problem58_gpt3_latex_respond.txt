The OCR output is not clear enough to accurately transcribe the mathematical expression. However, I can manually interpret the image and provide the LaTeX syntax and solution for the expression shown.
The expression appears to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the product of 
−9 and a cosine function. The function within the summation seems to involve cosine terms with 
2
πx
 and 
2
π(x−1)
.
I will now write out the LaTeX syntax for the expression and calculate the result. 
In the LaTeX syntax, the expression is (\sum_{{x=1}}^{{10}} -9 \cos \left( \frac{{\pi \cos \left(\frac{{\pi x}}{{2}}\right)}}{{2}} \right) \cos \left( \frac{{\pi \cos \left(\frac{{\pi (x - 1)}}{{2}}\right)}}{{2}} \right)
