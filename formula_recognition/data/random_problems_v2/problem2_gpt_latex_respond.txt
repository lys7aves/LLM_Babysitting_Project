Error analyzing
It seems there was an internal error while trying to solve the problem using the provided tools. However, I can still describe the process to you.
For the given expression:
∑
x=1
10
sin(π(
2
x
+
2
9
))
We would proceed as follows in a computational environment:
Define the variable 
x.
Construct the summation expression for 
sin(π(
2
x
+
2
9
)) from 
x=1 to 
x=10.
Compute the exact sum.
Evaluate the expression to get an approximate decimal value.
Unfortunately, due to the error, I cannot provide you with the exact and approximate values at this moment. If you have access to a computational tool like Python with SymPy, you could use the code structure I've provided above to compute the result. If you need further assistance or would like me to try again, please let me know.
