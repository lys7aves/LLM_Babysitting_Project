The OCR output is not clear enough to accurately determine the mathematical expression from the image. I will manually interpret the mathematical expression, solve the problem, and provide an approximate value.
Let me take a closer look at the image to proceed with the manual interpretation. 
The mathematical expression interpreted from the image is as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} \right)} + \pi \sin{\left(5 \pi x \right)}\right)
The exact solution to this expression is:
#solution: 1
And the approximate value is:
#evalf_value: 1.0
Please note that the exact and approximate values are the same in this case because the exact solution is a whole number.
