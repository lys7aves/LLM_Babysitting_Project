The optical character recognition (OCR) of the image did not provide an accurate result. I will manually interpret the mathematical expression in the image and provide you with the LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and an approximate value.
By observing the image, the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression is as follows:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
xπ
+
2
sin(
2
10xπ
)
)
I will now calculate the exact solution and an approximate value of this expression. 
The exact solution to the provided mathematical expression is 1, and the approximate value is also 1.00, as it is an integer result.
Here are the results in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{x\pi}{2} + \frac{\sin\left(\frac{10x\pi}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.00
