It appears there is a technical issue preventing the execution of the code necessary to solve the mathematical expression. However, I can guide you on how to approach this problem:
The LaTeX syntax for the given summation expression would be:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( (x + 5) - 10x \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right) \right)
To find the exact solution, you would need to evaluate the summation of the expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10. This involves computing the sine function for each value of 
x, which will oscillate based on the multiplier of 
π
2
π
.
The approximate value would be the decimal equivalent of the exact solution. Since the sine function can result in a maximum value of 1 or minimum of -1, and considering the multiplier for 
x, you can anticipate the result to be negative for certain terms of the summation where 
x is even (since 
sin(πx) where 
x is an integer results in 0, but the 
sin function is positive or negative depending on the quadrant).
