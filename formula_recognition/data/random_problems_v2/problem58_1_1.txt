It seems that the optical character recognition (OCR) did not successfully extract the text from the image. I will proceed by manually interpreting the mathematical expression in the image you provided.
I will write out the LaTeX syntax for the expression, calculate the exact solution, and then provide an approximate decimal value for the sum. Let's start with the LaTeX representation. 
The LaTeX syntax for the mathematical expression in the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
x
5
sin(
2
π
(cos(
2
π
(x−4))+
2
9
))
The exact solution involves trigonometric functions of multiple angles and is quite complex:
#solution: 17050\sin\left(\pi\left(4.5 - \frac{\sin(4)}{2}\right)\right) + 33792\sin\left(\pi\left(\frac{\cos(4)}{2} + 4.5\right)\right) + 62175\sin\left(\pi\left(\frac{\sin(4)}{2} + 4.5\right)\right) + 107808\sin\left(\pi\left(4.5 - \frac{\cos(4)}{2}\right)\right)
The approximate decimal value of the sum is:
#evalf_value: 102827.855150033
Please note that the exact solution is given in terms of sine functions evaluated at specific points, which is the result of the symbolic computation and may not be simplified to a rational number or a simpler form. The approximate value is a decimal representation of this exact symbolic result.
