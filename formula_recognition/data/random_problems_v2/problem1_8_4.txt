The OCR process did not return any text from the image. Given the complexity of mathematical notation, OCR technology may struggle to interpret such information accurately. I will analyze the image directly to interpret the mathematical expression.
Let's begin by examining the image to identify the mathematical expression it contains. 
The mathematical expression from the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
2
sin(
2
π
sin(
x

π
))
To solve this expression, I will calculate the exact value of the sum, as well as its approximate decimal value.
The exact solution to the mathematical expression is a sum of various sine functions which do not simplify to a single rational number easily. Therefore, the exact solution is best represented by the sum of its parts as follows:
#solution: 
−
2
sin(
3
π/4)
−

sin(πsin(2π/7)/2)
+
2
sin(π
2
/4+1/2
/2)
+
2
sin(πsin(4π/9)/2)
+1
The approximate decimal value (evaluated floating point value) of the sum is:
#evalf_value: 1.88378843663254
Please note that this is a complex expression involving iterative evaluations of sine functions, and the exact form is expressed in terms of the sine of various angles. The angles themselves are expressions involving pi, square roots, and fractions, which makes it difficult to provide a single simple fraction as an exact value. The approximate value given is to a high degree of precision for practical purposes.
