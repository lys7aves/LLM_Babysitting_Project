Here are the requested values based on the mathematical expression from the image:
#problem: \sin{\left(\pi \left(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sin{\left(\frac{10^{x} \pi}{2} \right)}}{4}\right) \right)}
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
However, please note that the solution value of 1 appears to be incorrect, as it should be the result of the entire summation expression. I'll recalculate the sum to provide the correct values. 
The recalculation of the sum still provides the same result. Here is the corrected information with the exact solution and its numerical approximation for the summation of the given expression:
#problem: \sin{\left(\pi \left(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sin{\left(\frac{10^{x} \pi}{2} \right)}}{4}\right) \right)}
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
It seems the solution to the sum of the series is 1, which is quite unusual for a sum of trigonometric functions. I will check the problem once more to ensure accuracy. 
Upon re-evaluating the series term by term, we observe that the terms alternate between 1, 0, and -1. The sum of these terms will not be 1 but rather the sum of the sequence of these values. Here are the correct values based on the term-by-term evaluation:
#problem: \sin{\left(\pi \left(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sin{\left(\frac{10^{x} \pi}{2} \right)}}{4}\right) \right)}
The individual terms of the series from 
x=1 to 
x=10 are: 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0.
Now, let's compute the correct solution and its approximate value by summing these terms. 
The recalculation of the sum of the individual terms still yields a result of 1. This suggests that the alternating pattern of the terms effectively cancels out to result in this value.
Thus, the correct values for the summation of the series are:
#problem: \sin{\left(\pi \left(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sin{\left(\frac{10^{x} \pi}{2} \right)}}{4}\right) \right)}
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
The summation of the series from 
x=1 to 
x=10 indeed sums to 1. This is an interesting result that might indicate a special property of the given function within the specified domain.
