The OCR attempt on the image did not return any readable text. I will now attempt to interpret the mathematical expression visually and provide the requested information.
Looking at the expression in the image, it seems to represent the following:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πcos(
2
π(x+
2
1
)
)
)
Now, I will calculate the exact and approximate values of this expression. 
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax is:
#problem: \sum_{{x=1}}^{10} \cos \left( \frac{{\pi \cos(\frac{{\pi (x + \frac{{1}}{{2}})}}{{2}})}}{{2}} \right)
The exact solution in terms of cosine of angles is:
#solution: 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{7\pi}{4}\right)}{2}\right) + 3\cos\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)}{2}\right) + 5\cos\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}\pi}{4}\right)
The approximate value of the summation is:
#evalf_value: 4.44015840326213
It's worth noting that the exact solution is expressed in terms of cosine of certain angles, which are themselves multiples of pi, reflecting the periodic nature of the cosine function. The approximate value is a numerical approximation of the sum of these cosines.
