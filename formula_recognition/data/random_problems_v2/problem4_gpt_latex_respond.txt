It seems that there is an issue with the execution environment that prevents me from directly solving the mathematical expression. However, I can guide you through the process and provide you with the LaTeX syntax for the expression.
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression given in the image is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \pi \left( \frac{5^x x^9}{2} \right) + x \right)
To solve this by hand or with a computer algebra system, you would need to calculate the sum of the sine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, where the argument of the sine function is 
Ï€(
2
5
x
x
9
)+x.
The exact solution would involve evaluating this sum symbolically, and the approximate value would be the decimal representation of this sum.
Since I cannot provide the exact and approximate solutions at this moment, you might want to use a computer algebra system like SymPy or Mathematica to compute these values. Here is what you would typically do in SymPy:
python
Copy code
from sympy import symbols, sin, pi, summation

x = symbols('x')
expr = sin(pi*(5**x * x**9/2) + x)
exact_sum = summation(expr, (x, 1, 1
