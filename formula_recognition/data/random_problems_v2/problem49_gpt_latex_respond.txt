It seems there is an issue with executing the code to solve the problem. However, I can provide you with the approach and how you would solve it using Python with the SymPy library:
To represent the expression in LaTeX syntax as it is written in the image, you would write:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} (x^4 + x)
To find the exact solution and an approximate value, you would use the following Python code:
python
Copy code
from sympy import symbols, summation

# Define the symbol
x = symbols('x')

# Define the expression
expression = x**4 + x

# Calculate the exact sum from x=1 to x=10
exact_sum = summation(expression, (x, 1, 10))

# Calculate the approximate value of the sum
approximate_value = float(exact_sum)
The exact_sum would give you the exact solution in fractional form if it's a rational number, and approximate_value would give you the decimal approximation.
