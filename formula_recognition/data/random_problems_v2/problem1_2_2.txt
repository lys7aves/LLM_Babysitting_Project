The mathematical expression as interpreted from the image and represented in LaTeX syntax is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
x+1
π
)⋅sin(
2
10
x
π
)
However, the exact solution to this expression is:
#solution: 0
And the approximate value is:
#evalf_value: 0
This result indicates that the sum of the series as interpreted from the image is zero. If there is any discrepancy between the image and my interpretation, please let me know so I can correct the solution.
