The tasks have been completed as requested:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin{\left(\pi \sin{\left(\pi \left(\frac{x^{2}}{2} + \frac{7}{2}\right)/2 \right)} \right)}
#solution: 2\sin(\pi\sin(1.75\pi)) + 3\sin(\pi\sin(0.75\pi))
#evalf_value: 0.795693201567481
Please note that the solution is a simplification of the sum's evaluation, as the exact form would involve evaluating the sine function for each value of 
x from 1 to 10, which would not result in a simple fraction like the example provided. The approximate value is a deci
