The OCR output did not correctly interpret the mathematical expression from the image. I will manually analyze the image to provide you with the LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let's take a closer look at the mathematical expression in the image. 
The mathematical expression in the image is somewhat complex due to the nested fractions and the summation. However, I can transcribe it into LaTeX syntax. Once we have the LaTeX syntax, I can calculate the exact solution and its approximate decimal value.
Please give me a moment to analyze the expression and perform the necessary calculations.
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax, as written in the image, is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{x + \sin\left(\frac{\pi \sin\left(10^x \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{2}\right)}
The exact solution is:
#solution: \frac{263}{315}
And the approximate decimal value is:
#evalf_value: 0.834920634920635
