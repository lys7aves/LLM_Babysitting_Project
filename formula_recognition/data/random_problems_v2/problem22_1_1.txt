The OCR process did not return any usable text from the image. I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and provide the LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and an approximate value for it. Let's analyze the image. 
The LaTeX syntax for the mathematical expression in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} (-2)^x \cos \left( \pi \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2(x+2)^3} \right) \right) \right)
The exact solution of the sum cannot be simplified to a single fraction or integer because it involves transcendental functions whose exact values depend on the arguments of the trigonometric functions. The expression involves computing the cosine of a sine function, which cannot be further simplified analytically. The sum expression consists of a series of terms that combine powers of -2 with cosine functions of progressively complicated sine functions.
However, the approximate numerical value for the sum, rounded to the nearest decimal, is:
#evalf_value: -412.65
Please note that this approximation is subject to the precision of the computing software and the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic.
