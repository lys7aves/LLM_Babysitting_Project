It seems there was an issue with the interpretation of the mathematical expression which resulted in an undefined solution (nan). I will analyze the expression again and ensure the correct LaTeX syntax and solution are provided.
Let's revisit the mathematical expression from the image and write it in LaTeX correctly before solving it. 
The mathematical expression from the image, when represented in LaTeX syntax, is as follows:
#problem: \sum_{{x=1}}^{{10}} 2^{{-\sin\left(\frac{{\pi x}}{2}\right)}}
The exact solution for this summation is:
#solution: \frac{21}{2}
And the approximate value of this solution is:
#evalf_value: 10.5
