The mathematical expression in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{\sin{\left(\pi \cos{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} \right)} \right)}}{\pi \sin{\left(\frac{\pi \cos{\left(4 \pi x \right)}}{2} \right)}}
However, the solution to this expression is actually 0. This means that the exact solution and the approximate value are both:
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0
The sum evaluates to zero because the denominator becomes undefined for the given range of x, which implies that the terms of the series do not contribute to a sum.
