It seems there is an issue with the execution of the code at the moment. However, I can still provide you with the LaTeX representation of the expression and explain how you would solve it.
The LaTeX for the expression in the image is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{1}{2^x}
To solve it, you would calculate the sum of the series for 
x ranging from 1 to 10. This is a geometric series with the first term 
a=
2
1
 and the common ratio 
r=
2
1
. The sum of the first 
n terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:
S
n
=a
1−r
1−r
n
For this series, the exact solution 
S
10
 would be:
S
10
=
2
1
1−

1−(

)
10
I can provide the approximate value using a calculator:
