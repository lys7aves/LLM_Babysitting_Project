Error analyzing
There seems to have been a small error in my code where I used sympy.latex without importing sympy properly. Let me correct that and run the calculation again. 
Here are the results:
#problem: \sin{\left(\frac{\pi x \sin{\left(\frac{\pi x^{2}}{2} \right)}}{2} \right)}
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
