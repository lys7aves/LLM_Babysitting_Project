It seems that the OCR was not able to extract the text from the image correctly. I will directly analyze the mathematical expression from the image and provide you with the LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and an approximate value as requested. Let's start by interpreting the mathematical expression visually. 
Based on the image, the mathematical expression can be interpreted as follows:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
xπ
+sin(
2
πsin(
2
10
x
π
)
))
Now, let's calculate the exact solution and an approximate decimal value for this expression using Python. 
The exact solution to the given mathematical expression is 1, which means the sum evaluates to a whole number. Here are the details in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{x \pi}{2} + \sin\left(\frac{\pi \sin\left(\frac{10^x \pi}{2}\right)}{2}\right)\right)
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.0
