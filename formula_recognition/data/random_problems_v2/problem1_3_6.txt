The output from the OCR is not clear and contains many errors. Since the OCR result is not accurate, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and provide the LaTeX syntax, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let me transcribe and solve the expression. 
The mathematical expression from the image represented in LaTeX syntax is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} + \frac{\sin\left(\frac{10 \pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
The exact solution for the summation is:
#solution: 1
The approximate value of the summation is:
#evalf_value: 1.0
Please note that this solution assumes that the interpretation of the expression from the image is accurate to the intent of the problem. If there are any specificities in the image that have not been captured in this interpretation, please let me know.
