It seems that the OCR was not able to extract the text from the image of the mathematical expression successfully. Since OCR has failed to recognize the content, I will analyze the image manually.
I'll write down the LaTeX representation of the expression and then calculate the exact and approximate values of the expression. Let's start with interpreting the LaTeX syntax. 
Error analyzing
It appears there was an issue with parsing the LaTeX expression using the available Python libraries due to missing dependencies. Instead, I will manually construct the symbolic expression using the sympy library, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.
I will represent the expression in LaTeX and then proceed to calculate its exact and approximate values. Let's move forward with that. 
The interpreted LaTeX expression of the mathematical problem as seen in the image is as follows:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
9π
(xsin(
2
π
(
7
x
−
2
7
)))
x
)
The exact solution in terms of symbolic expression is:
cos(
2
243π
sin(
2
1.53571428571429π
)
3
)+cos(1152πsin(
2
1.46428571428571π
)
4
)+⋯+cos(45000000000πsin(
2
1.03571428571429π
)
10
)
And the approximate value of the summation is approximately 
2.53424128360258.
In the requested format, the values are:
#problem:
