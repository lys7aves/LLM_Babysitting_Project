The mathematical expression from the image has been interpreted and represented in LaTeX syntax. However, the exact solution and its approximate value are not computable in a closed form with the tools available. The expression involves a transcendental function which does not simplify to an algebraic number that can be easily represented or computed. Therefore, both the exact solution and the approximate value are not a number (nan), indicating that the value is undefined or unrepresentable.
Here are the requested outputs:
#problem: \cos{\left(\frac{2 \pi x^{2.5}}{\cos{\left(\frac{\pi \sin{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}}{2} \right)}} \right)}
#solution: nan
#evalf_value: nan
Please note that this problem involv
