The OCR result is not clear enough to interpret the mathematical expression accurately. I will manually inspect the image and provide the LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let's proceed by interpreting the mathematical expression from the image. 
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression from the image is as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{x\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi\sin\left(\frac{10x\pi}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
Now, I will calculate the exact solution and the approximate value of this expression.
The exact solution and the approximate value of the given mathematical expression are:
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
