The results for the given mathematical expression are as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( x + \sin \left( 4\pi \sin \left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right) \right) \right)
#solution: 55
#evalf_value: 55.0
The exact solution is an integer, so the approximate value is the same as the exact solution in this case.
