The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process to interpret the mathematical expression from the image has taken too long and was automatically interrupted. Instead of relying on OCR, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression based on the image provided.
From the image, the mathematical expression appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πx
+sin(
2
πsin(
2
10xπ
)
))
I will now calculate the exact solution and an approximate value for this expression. 
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πx
+sin(
2
πsin(
2
10xπ
)
))
The exact solution is:
#solution: 1
The approximate value is:
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
