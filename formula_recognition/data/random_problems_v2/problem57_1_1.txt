The given mathematical expression in LaTeX syntax is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} (-10) \left( \sin^{ \pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}(x) \right)
The exact solution is a complex number which indicates that some values within the summation result in complex numbers due to the power of sine being a negative real number:
#solution: -50 - 10\sin(2)^{-\pi} - 10\sin(8)^{\pi} - 10\sin(6)^{-\pi} - 10\sin(10)^{-\pi} - 10\sin(4)^{\pi}
The approximate value (which includes an imaginary part) is:
#evalf_value: 487.391389926053 - 263.618846083398i
Please note that the imaginary part arises from taking the sine to a negative power, which is not defined for real numbers and therefore results in a complex number. If you were expecting only real numbers, there might be an issue with the interp
