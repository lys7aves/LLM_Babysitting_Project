The OCR process did not successfully extract the mathematical expression from the image. I will manually interpret the expression from the image and proceed with solving it.
Let's first transcribe the expression into LaTeX format. Then I'll compute the exact solution and its approximate value. 
It appears there was an error in calculating the exact solution and its approximate value, likely due to an issue with the interpretation of the expression from the image.
I will need to manually inspect the image and write out the correct LaTeX expression before attempting to calculate the solution again. Please allow me a moment to do this. 
I will now manually interpret the LaTeX expression from the image and then solve it for the exact and approximate values.
LaTeX Interpretation:
The mathematical expression appears to be a summation, which I will transcribe into LaTeX syntax.
Exact Solution:
I will calculate the exact solution using the interpreted expression.
Approximate Value:
Lastly, I will provide an approximate decimal value for the exact solution obtained.
I will follow up with the results shortly.
The tasks have been completed as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \sin \left( \frac{10 \pi}{2x} \right) \right)
#solution: -\sin\left(\sqrt{3}\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \sin\left(\sqrt{2}\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{7}\right)\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{1}{2}}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{9}\right)\right) + 2
#evalf_value: 3.76757687326508
Please note that the solution is expressed in terms of sine functions involving 
Ï€ and square roots, which cannot be simplified into a neat fraction or a simpler form. The approximate value, which is a decimal representation of the exact solution, is approximately 3.7676.
