The LaTeX syntax for the given mathematical expression is as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{\sin(x)}{2 \left( \cos(x) + \frac{\sin(x)}{2} \right)}
The exact solution of the mathematical expression cannot be simplified to a simple fraction or a closed form as it involves trigonometric functions evaluated at integer arguments. Hence, the exact solution is the sum of the ten terms given by the symbolic computation:
#solution: \sin(9)/(2*(\cos(9) + \sin(9)/2)) + \sin(6)/(2*(\sin(6)/2 + \cos(6))) + \sin(3)/(2*(\cos(3) + \sin(3)/2)) + \sin(10)/(2*(\cos(10) + \sin(10)/2)) + \sin(7)/(2*(\sin(7)/2 + \cos(7))) + \sin(4)/(2*(\cos(4) + \sin(4)/2)) + \sin(1)/(2*(\sin(1)/2 + \cos(1))) + \sin(8)/(2*(\cos(8) + \sin(8)/2)) + \sin(5)/(2*(\sin(5)/2 + \cos(5))) + \sin(2)/(2*(\cos(2) + \sin(2)/2))
And the approximate value of the sum is:
