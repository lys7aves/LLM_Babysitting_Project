The OCR did not successfully recognize the text in the image. Since the image contains a mathematical expression, I will manually interpret it and provide the LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and an approximate value.
The expression in the image appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
sin
⎝
⎛
2
πcos
x
(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
To solve this, I will calculate the exact value of the sum as well as an approximate decimal value. Let's proceed with the calculation. 
Here are the results for the mathematical expression you provided:
LaTeX syntax of the expression:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin{\left(\frac{\pi \cos^{x}{\left(\frac{\pi \cos{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}}{2} \right)}}{2} \right)}
The exact solution of the sum: 
5
The approximate decimal value: 
5.00000000000000
