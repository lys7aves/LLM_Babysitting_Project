It seems that the OCR process did not yield any readable text from the image. I will analyze the image directly and provide the LaTeX representation, exact solution, and an approximate value for the mathematical expression.
Let's start with the LaTeX representation of the expression. 
The LaTeX representation, exact solution, and approximate value of the mathematical expression from the image are:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} + \sin{\left(\frac{10^{x} \pi}{2} \right)} \right)}
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
Please note that this interpretation assumes that each sine function wraps the entire subsequent term, as this is the standard interpretation without additional parentheses to indicate otherwise. If the expression in the image was meant to be different, please provide additional context or clarification.
