The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} x \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2x}\right)
The exact solution, represented as a sum of various terms involving square roots and sines, is:
#solution: -5\sqrt{2}\sqrt{\frac{5}{8} - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{8}} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{5}{4} + 4\sqrt{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}} + 7\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{14}\right) + 8\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{16}\right) + 9\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{18}\right) + \frac{5\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{3\sqrt{6}}{2} + 5\sqrt{2}\left(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}\right)
The approximate value of the sum is:
#evalf_value: 14.7884938975512
Please note that the exact solution is not given as a simple fraction but as a combination of several terms involving square roots and trigonometric function
