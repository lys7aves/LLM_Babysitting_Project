To solve the problem, I'll first transcribe the mathematical expression from the image into LaTeX syntax. Then, I'll calculate the exact solution and an approximate value for the expression. Let's start by interpreting the expression.
The tasks have been completed as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{\sin{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}}{x + \frac{\sin{\left(\frac{\pi \sin{\left(\frac{10^{x} \pi}{2} \right)}}{2} \right)}}{2}}
#solution: \frac{263}{315}
#evalf_value: 0.834920634920635
