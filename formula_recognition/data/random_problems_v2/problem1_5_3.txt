The text extracted from the image is not clear enough to accurately interpret the mathematical expression. To solve the problem correctly, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image.
Looking at the image, I can see that the mathematical expression is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
xπ
+
2
πsin(
2
10xπ
)
)
This expression sums the sine of a function of 
x from 
x=1 to 
x=10. To find the exact solution and its approximate value, I will calculate this sum numerically.
Let's proceed with the calculation. 
The exact solution to the mathematical expression is 
1, and the approximate value is also 
1.0.
Here are the requested values in the specified format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{x \pi}{2} + \frac{\pi \sin \left( \frac{10 x \pi}{2} \right)}{2} \right)
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.0
