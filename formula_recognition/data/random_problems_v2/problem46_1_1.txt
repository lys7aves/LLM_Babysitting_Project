It appears that the OCR process did not successfully extract text from the image of the mathematical expression. This means I will need to interpret the mathematical expression visually myself and then provide the LaTeX representation, exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let's proceed with interpreting the expression. 
The mathematical expression from the image can be represented in LaTeX syntax as follows:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
cos
⎝
⎛
2
πx
+
2
πcos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
⎠
⎞
To find the exact and approximate solutions, I will calculate the sum of the cosine of the given expression as 
x varies from 1 to 10. Let's proceed with the calculation.
The exact solution to the sum of the given expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is zero, which means that the approximate value is also zero. This result indicates that the sum of the cosine of the angles as defined by the expression sums up to zero over the given range of 
x.
Here are the requested values in the specified format:
