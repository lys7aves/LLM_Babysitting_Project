The OCR output contains several inaccuracies and is not providing a clear representation of the mathematical expression in the image. I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and provide you with the LaTeX syntax, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let's proceed with the interpretation of the expression. 
The mathematical expression in the image is a summation that I will interpret manually. Here is the LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and an approximate value for the expression:

)
Exact solution
The exact solution for this summation cannot be given as a simple fraction or decimal because it involves the sine function, which depends on the value of 
x and can be transcendental. Each term of the summation would need to be evaluated individually.
Approximate value
To obtain an approximate value, we would evaluate the sine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and sum the results. This can be done using a numerical approach, typically with a calculator or computational software.
I will now calculate the approximate value of the summation.
The LaTeX syntax for the expression from the image is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{x \pi}{2} + \frac{\sin\left(\frac{10x \pi}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
The exact solution involves evaluating the sine function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, which generally yields a transcendental number that is not representable as a simple fraction.
The approximate value of the summation is very close to 1.0000000000000038, which we can round to 1 for practical purposes, considering numerical precision limitations.
Here is the formatted result:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{x \pi}{2} + \frac{\sin\left(\frac{10x \pi}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
#solution: Not applicable (transcendental number)
#evalf_value: 1.0000000000000038
