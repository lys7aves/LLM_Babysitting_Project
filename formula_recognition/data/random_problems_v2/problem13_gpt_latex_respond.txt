It seems there was an error in the code due to a missing import. I will correct this and attempt to solve the expression again. Let's start by transcribing the expression from the image into LaTeX and attempting to solve it. 
Error analyzing
There was another error in the code due to the latex function not being imported correctly. I will correct this and evaluate the expression once more. Let's try again. 
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression from the image is:
x=1
∑
10
2
πsinxcos
−πcos(
2
x
)
(πcos
2
(x))
However, the exact solution of this summation does not simplify to a closed form and can only be computed as a numerical sum. It appears that the solution contains a complex part, which suggests that there may be an issue with the interpretation of the expression. This is likely due to the complexity and potential ambiguity when interpreting handwritten or complex mathematical expressions from an image.
The approximate numerical value calculated is 
8.57908002480869+0.959739833934739i, which indicates a complex number.
Given the complex result, it is possible that the original expression may have been misinterpreted, as most sums of this type would be expected to yield a real number. If you can provide additional context or clarification on the expression, I can attempt to correct the interpretation.
For the sake of completion, here are the values formatted as requested:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{\pi \sin{x} \cos^{- \pi \cos{\left(\frac{x}{2} \right)}}{\left(\pi \cos^{2}{\left(x \right)} \right)}}{2}
#solution: Not simplified to a closed form
#evalf_value: 8.57908002480869 + 0.959739833934739i
