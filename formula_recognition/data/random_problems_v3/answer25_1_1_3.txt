It appears there's an issue with running the calculation directly. I will attempt a different approach to solving the mathematical problem from the image. Let's try breaking down the expression into simpler parts if possible and computing it step by step. I will now proceed with the calculations.

It seems we are encountering persistent technical difficulties that prevent the calculation from being executed. Normally, the process would involve defining the mathematical expression within a symbolic algebra system, and then using that system to compute the exact sum and its approximate numerical value.
Despite the error, I can provide you with the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression from the image. You can use this LaTeX code to render the expression in a document or a LaTeX editor:
LaTeX syntax:
2
−sin(x)sin(πsin(
2
πx
))
To solve the sum of this expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10, you would typically use a computational tool capable of symbolic mathematics, such as Python's SymPy library or other mathematics software like Mathematica or Maple. These tools can provide both exact and approximate numerical solutions.
Unfortunately, without the computational capabilities, I can't provide the exact and approximate solutions at this time. If you have access to any symbolic computation software, you can use the LaTeX syntax provided to input and solve the expression.
