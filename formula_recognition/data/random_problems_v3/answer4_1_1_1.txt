The OCR output is not providing a clear interpretation of the mathematical expression. Therefore, I will manually interpret the expression based on the image.
To provide you with the LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and an approximate value, I will need to first write out the expression in LaTeX syntax, then use Python to calculate the exact solution and its decimal approximation. Let's start with the LaTeX syntax.
