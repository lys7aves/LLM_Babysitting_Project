It seems there was an internal error when attempting to calculate the values you requested. I will attempt the calculations again. Please bear with me.

I apologize, but it seems there's a persistent issue with performing the calculation. Let's try a different approach to resolve this. I will try to perform the calculation one more time.

Unfortunately, the issue persists and I am unable to perform the calculation directly at the moment. However, I can guide you through the process so you can solve the expression on your own.
The expression from the image can be written in LaTeX as follows:

Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \left(6x \left(\sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right) + 10\right)^8 - 8\right)
To solve this expression manually or with a software that can handle symbolic computation, follow these steps:
Recognize that the sine function will produce a repeating pattern because it is within a sum over an integer sequence.
For each integer value of x from 1 to 10, calculate the value of sin(πx/2). Note that for integer multiples of 4, this sine function will be zero.
Raise the result of the sine function plus 10 to the power of 8.
Multiply by 6x and subtract 8.
Sum the results of the above calculation for each integer x from 1 to 10.
The exact solution would be the sum obtained from the above steps, and the approximate value would be a decimal representation of that sum.
Due to the repeated pattern of sine, you can simplify your calculations by grouping terms with the same sine value. Remember that sin(πx/2) will be 1, 0, -1, or 0 for x being 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively, and this pattern will repeat for x values 5 to 8, and then 9 to 10.
You can use any software that supports symbolic mathematics, such as Wolfram Alpha, MATLAB, or even a programming language with appropriate libraries (like Python with SymPy), to obtain the exact and approximate values.
