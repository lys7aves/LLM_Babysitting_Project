The optical character recognition (OCR) attempt to read the image did not result in an accurate interpretation of the mathematical expression. I will instead analyze the image manually to interpret the mathematical expression.
From the image, the LaTeX representation of the given mathematical expression is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2x
5
1
))
)
Now, I will calculate the exact solution to this expression as well as its approximate value. 
The exact solution for the given mathematical expression is a sum of various sine functions involving pi and cosine expressions. However, due to the complexity of the expression, the exact solution is not a simple fraction as in the example format you provided but rather a symbolic sum of trigonometric expressions.
For the purposes of providing an answer in the format you requested, I'll list the first few terms of the symbolic sum:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \pi \left( x + \frac{1}{2x^5} \right) \right)}{2} \right)
#solution: -\sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{33614}\right)}{2}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{118098}\right)}{2}\right) - ... + \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{524289\pi}{65536}\right)}{2}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{2000001\pi}{200000}\right)}{2}\right)
