The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2
π
))
)
The exact solution for this expression is a sum of trigonometric terms:
#solution: 
sin(πcos(π(
2
1
+
4
π
)))+sin(πcos(π(
4
π
+
2
5
)))+sin(πcos(π(
4
π
+
2
9
)))+sin(πcos(π(
4
π
+2)))+sin(πcos(π(
4
π
+4)))+sin(πcos(π(
4
π
+1)))+sin(πcos(π(
4
π
+3)))+sin(πcos(π(
4
π
+5)))+sin(πcos(π(
4
π
+
2
3
)))+sin(πcos(π(
4
π
+
2
7
)))
The approximate value of this sum is:
#evalf_value: -0.290273748887013
Please note that the exact solution is not a simple fraction but a sum of trigonometric function evaluations, which is why it is represented as a sum of terms rather than a single fraction.
