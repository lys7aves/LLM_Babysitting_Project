I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that there is a persistent issue with the computation. However, I can still provide you with the LaTeX representation of the expression as seen in the image. Here it is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin^x \left(x \right) \frac{\pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}{2}
For the exact solution and the approximate value, normally I would calculate these using the Python environment here, but since there's an issue with the execution, I am unable to provide these values at this moment. If you have access to a mathematical software or computational tool like Python with the SymPy library installed, you could run the
