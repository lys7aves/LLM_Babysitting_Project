It seems that there's an issue with the execution environment currently, which is preventing me from computing the exact and approximate values of the expression. However, I can provide you with the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression from the image you've provided.
The LaTeX syntax for the expression in the image is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{\pi (70x + 49)}{2^{\sin \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( (-6)^x \frac{\pi}{2} \right)}{2} \right)}} \right)
For the exact and approximate values, I would typically evaluate the summation for x from 1 to 10 using a symbolic computation library like SymPy in Python. Unfortunately, due to the technical issue, I can't provide these values at the moment. If the environment becomes responsive again, I will be able to perform the computation for you.
