The OCR result is not accurate enough to give a precise representation of the mathematical expression in the image. However, based on what can be seen in the image, I will transcribe the expression into LaTeX and solve it manually.
Given the visible parts and typical mathematical notation, the expression seems to be a summation where the upper limit is 10 and the lower limit is 1. The function being summed appears to be a sine function that involves an inner cosine function and a linear term in 
x.
I will now manually interpret the expression, write it in LaTeX, solve it for the exact value, and provide an approximate decimal value. Let's proceed with the interpretation and calculation. 
Based on the manual interpretation of the image, the LaTeX representation of the problem is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
π(70x+49)
)sin(
2
πcos(−
π
6
⋅
2
π
x)
)
The exact solution as a sum of sine terms involving pi and cosine is:
−sin(πcos(3))+sin(πcos(6))−sin(πcos(9))+sin(πcos(30))+sin(πcos(12))−sin(πcos(15))−sin(πcos(27))+sin(πcos(18))+sin(πcos(24))−sin(πcos(21))
The approximate numerical value of the summation is:
