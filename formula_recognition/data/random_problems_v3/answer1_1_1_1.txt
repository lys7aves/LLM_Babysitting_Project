It seems there was an internal error while trying to read the text from the image using OCR. I will attempt another method to interpret the mathematical expression. Let me analyze the image and provide you with the LaTeX representation, exact solution, and an approximate value. Please give me a moment.

It appears there is an issue with the execution environment that is preventing me from processing the expression directly. However, I can still provide you with the LaTeX syntax based on the image you've provided. Here's how you can transcribe the expression into LaTeX, and then I'll guide you through solving it manually.
Given the structure of the equation in the image, the LaTeX syntax seems to be:
latex
Copy code
\frac{\sum_{x=1}^{10} \pi \sin \left( \frac{9 \cos \left( \pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\sin \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}{2} \right) \right)}{2} \right) + \frac{81}{2}}{2}
Now, let's proceed to calculate the exact and approximate values manually. We'll use symbolic computation to evaluate the expression. Please hold on while I do the calculations.

I apologize for the inconvenience, but it seems that there is a persistent issue with the execution environment that is preventing me from calculating the exact and approximate values of the expression.
However, you can compute the value using any symbolic mathematics software like SymPy in Python or a computational tool like Mathematica or MATLAB. Here's how you could structure your computation in such software using the LaTeX expression I provided earlier:
Define the summation expression with the correct limits.
Calculate the sum to get the exact solution.
Evaluate the sum to a floating-point number to get the approximate value.
For example, in Python with SymPy, you would first define x as a symbol, then construct the expression using SymPy's functions that mirror mathematical functions, and finally use sympy.summation() to get the exact result and .evalf() to get the floating-point approximation.
If you have access to Python, I can guide you through the code you would need to write. Otherwise, you might need to use a tool like Wolfram Alpha which can process LaTeX directly and give you both the exact and numerical solutions. Would you like guidance on how to perform these calculations yourself?
