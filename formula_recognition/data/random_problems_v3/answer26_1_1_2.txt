I apologize for the inconvenience, but it seems that there is an internal issue preventing me from executing the code to solve the mathematical expression. However, I can guide you through the process.
To solve the given expression manually, you would follow these steps:
Recognize that the expression inside the summation is 
x+sin
4
(
2
πx
).
You would then evaluate this expression for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10 and sum the results.
The sine function squared to the fourth power will only yield significant values for 
x equal to 1 and 2 in the given range because for 
x≥3, 
sin(
2
πx
) will result in 0 or 
±1, and its fourth power will be 1. However, for 
x even, 
sin(
2
πx
) is 0, so its fourth power is also 0.
The LaTeX representation of the summation is written as:
x=1
∑
10
(x+sin
4
(
2
πx
))
Unfortunately, without executing the code, I cannot provide the exact and approximate solutions.
If you have access to a computational tool like Python with SymPy, or another mathematical software, you could use the provided LaTeX expression to compute the exact and approximate values.
