The OCR has not successfully extracted the mathematical expression from the image. I will manually interpret the image to provide the LaTeX representation, solve the problem, and give you the approximate value.
Let's proceed step by step. First, I'll transcribe the mathematical expression into LaTeX syntax. 
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax from the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos\left(\frac{\pi \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
The exact solution to this summation is:
#solution: 5
The approximate value (which in this case is the same as the exact value because the sum is an integer) is:
#evalf_value: 5.0
