The OCR has extracted text from the images, but the output is not clear and contains errors, which is common with complex mathematical expressions. To accurately interpret and transcribe the expression into LaTeX syntax, solve the problem, and provide an approximate value, I will need to manually inspect the images. Let's proceed with that. 
After inspecting the image, the mathematical expression can be represented in LaTeX as follows:
LaTeX Expression:
2
∑
x=1
10
cos
⎝
⎛

+sin(
2
πx
))
)
⎠
⎞
