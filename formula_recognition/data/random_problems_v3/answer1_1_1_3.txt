The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as seen in the image is as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \left[ \frac{\pi \sin \left( \pi \right) 9 \cos \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \left( x + \frac{\sin \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}{2} \right) \right)}{2} \right)}{2} + \frac{81}{2} \right]
However, there's an interpretation to be made here. The part of the expression 
πsin(π) evaluates to 0 because 
sin(π) is 0. Likewise, 
cos(π/2) also evaluates to 0. Therefore, the only non-zero term in the summation is 
2
81
, and since we are summing this term from 
x=1 to 
x=10, the sum will be ten times 
2
81
, which is 
1
405
.
The exact solution and the approximate value are the same in this case, since the result is a simple numerical value:
#solution: \frac{405}{1}
#evalf_value: 405.0
This interpretation assumes that the expression to be summed is independent of 
x, which is consistent with the mathematical properties of the functions involved (specifically, that 
sin(π)=0 and 
cos(π/2)=0).
