To solve the mathematical problem in the image, I'll go through the following steps:
Interpret the mathematical expression from the image.
Write down the expression in LaTeX syntax.
Calculate the exact solution.
Provide an approximate value for the solution.
Let's start by interpreting the expression. I'll examine the image and then proceed with the calculations.
It seems that the OCR process did not yield any readable text from the image, which is often the case with mathematical expressions due to their complexity and the presence of symbols that are not part of the standard OCR character set.
Therefore, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and proceed with the LaTeX representation and calculations accordingly. Let's start by identifying the LaTeX syntax for the given expression. 
Upon reviewing the image, here is the interpretation of the mathematical expression in LaTeX syntax:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
2
x
sin(
2
πx
)
Now, I will calculate the exact solution and its approximate value.
The exact solution and its approximate value for the given mathematical expression are as follows:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
2
x
sin(
2
πx
)
#solution:
