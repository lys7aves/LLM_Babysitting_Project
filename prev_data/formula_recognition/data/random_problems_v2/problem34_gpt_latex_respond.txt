Error analyzing
It seems there was an internal error while trying to calculate the solution to the mathematical expression. Let me try again.

I apologize, but it seems that there is a persistent issue preventing me from calculating the solution to the expression. Despite this, I can provide you with the LaTeX representation of the expression you provided:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
(sin(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)+5)
For the exact solution and approximate value, under normal circumstances, I would calculate them using a symbolic computation library like SymPy in Python. However, due to the internal error, I'm unable to do so at this time. Normally, the Sum function along with the doit() method would be used to find the exact solution, and the evalf() method to find the approximate value. If you have access to a computational tool like SymPy or Mathematica, you can use the provided LaTeX representation as a basis to compute the answer.
