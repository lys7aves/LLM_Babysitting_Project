The OCR has not provided a clear transcription of the mathematical expression from the image. I'll proceed to manually interpret the mathematical expression, solve the problem, and provide the LaTeX representation, exact solution, and an approximate value as requested.
Given the complexity of OCR for mathematical expressions, especially when they contain symbols and are structured in a complex manner, it is often more reliable to interpret them manually. Let's start by manually interpreting the expression. 
Upon examining the image, the mathematical expression can be written in LaTeX as:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πx
)
To solve this expression, we need to compute the sum of the sine of (
2
πx
) for 
x ranging from 1 to 10.
The sine function has a period of 
2π, so 
sin(
2
πx
) will repeat its values for each increment of 
x by 4. Therefore, the sine function will yield a sequence of values for 
x=1,2,3,4 and then repeat this sequence for 
x=5,6,7,8 and so on.
The values for the sine function at these points are:
sin(
2
π
)=1
sin(π)=0
sin(
2
3π
)=−1
sin(2π)=0
Given this pattern, we can calculate the exact sum and the approximate value. Let's perform this calculation.
The result of the sum is as follows:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πx
)
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.0
This result indicates that the sum of the sine function for the given range is exactly 1, and the approximate decimal value is also 1.0.
