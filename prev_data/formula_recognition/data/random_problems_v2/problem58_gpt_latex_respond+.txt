The OCR process did not yield any readable text from the image. Given this, I will proceed to interpret the mathematical expression from the image manually and calculate the solution.
The mathematical expression from the image appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
x
5
sin(
2
π
(
2
cos(π(x−
π
4
))
+
2
9
))
I will now calculate the exact solution and its approximate value. 
The exact solution to the given mathematical expression is a symbolic sum of terms involving sines of pi multiples which cannot be simplified to a single rational number. The expression as a symbolic sum is:
sin(π(
4
cos(π(1−
π
4
))
+2.25))+32sin(π(
4
cos(π(2−
π
4
))
+2.25))+…+100000sin(π(
4
cos(π(10−
π
4
))
+2.25))
The approximate value of this summation is:
114357.552976680
114357.552976680
Therefore, in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} x^5 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{\cos(\pi (x - \frac{4}{\pi}))}{2} + \frac{9}{2} \right) \right)
#solution: (Symbolic sum cannot be expressed as a single rational number)
#evalf_value: 114357.552976680
