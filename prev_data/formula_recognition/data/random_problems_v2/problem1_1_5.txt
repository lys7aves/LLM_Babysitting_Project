The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} + \sin\left(\frac{\pi \sin\left(10^x \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{2}\right)\right)
The exact solution for the summation of the expression from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is:
#solution: 1
And the approximate value for this sum is:
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
