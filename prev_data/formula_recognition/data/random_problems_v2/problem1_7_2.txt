The OCR output is not clear and contains many inaccuracies. I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and provide you with the LaTeX syntax, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let me start by interpreting the mathematical expression. 
The expression in the image appears to be a complex mathematical formula involving a sum, trigonometric functions, and a fraction. However, due to the nature of the image and the complexity of the expression, a direct OCR interpretation is not accurate.
Given the limitations of OCR technology with complex mathematical expressions and the need for precise interpretation, I will manually transcribe the expression into LaTeX format based on my analysis of the image. After that, I will calculate the exact solution and its approximate value.
Please allow me a moment to perform these calculations.
After manually interpreting and calculating the mathematical expression from the image, here are the results:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( \sin\left(\frac{x \pi}{2}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi \sin\left(10x \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{2}\right) \right)
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
However, I must note that this interpretation may not fully capture the complexity of the original image due to the limitations in resolving the exact nature of the expression via OCR and visual analysis. If you require a more precise LaTeX transcription or the expression is different from what I have interpreted, please provide additional context or clarification.
