The OCR result is not providing a clear transcription of the mathematical expression in the image. I will manually interpret the expression in the image to provide the LaTeX syntax, solve it, and give an approximate value.
First, I will interpret the mathematical expression visually and provide the LaTeX syntax. Then I will calculate the exact solution and its approximate value. Let's proceed with the interpretation. 
The exact LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression in the image is as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} + \sin{\left(\frac{\pi \sin{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}}{2} \right)} \right)}
The exact solution for this expression is cos(1), which in this context seems to be the result of evaluating the sum at x=1, since the sum of multiple sine functions would not simplify to a single cosine function. This might be an indicator that the interpretation of the sum could be incorrect. However, based on the interpreted expression, the approximate numerical value of cos(1) is:
#evalf_value: 0.540302305868140
Please note that the exact solution in symbolic form may not represent the actual sum of the series if the interpretation is not correct. The given approximate value is based on the interpreted expression provided. If you believe there has been a misinterpretation, please provide further clarification or the correct expression.
