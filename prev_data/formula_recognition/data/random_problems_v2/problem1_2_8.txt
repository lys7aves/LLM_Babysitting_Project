It seems that the OCR process did not yield any readable text from the image. I will analyze the expression visually and provide the LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
Firstly, let's transcribe the expression into LaTeX syntax. 
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{\pi \sin\left( \frac{10^x \pi}{2} \right)}{2} \right)
However, according to the evaluation performed, the exact solution of this sum is:
#solution: 0
And the approximate value (which in this case is the same as the exact value) is:
#evalf_value: 0
It appears that the summation of this trigonometric function results in zero, which might be surprising. It suggests that the individual terms of the summation may cancel each other out, or that each term is itself zero. This outcome can occur with trigonometric functions that have specific symmetries or periodicities. If you suspect that this result does not match your expectations or if there are additional conditions or contexts to the problem, please provide further details.
