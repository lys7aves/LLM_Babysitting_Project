It seems that the OCR process did not return any text from the image, which can happen with complex mathematical expressions. I will manually transcribe the expression from the image and provide you with the LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and approximate value.
Based on the image, the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
xπ
+
2
πsin(
2
10
x
π
)
)
I will now calculate the exact solution of this expression and its approximate value. 
The exact solution to the given mathematical expression is 1, and the approximate value (to a reasonable number of decimal places) is also 1. Here is the information in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{x \pi}{2} + \frac{\pi \sin\left(\frac{10^{x} \pi}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
#solution: 1
#evalf_value: 1.00000000000000
