To solve the problem, I'll first transcribe the mathematical expression from the image into LaTeX syntax.
Once the LaTeX representation is ready, I'll use it to calculate the exact solution to the expression. After obtaining the exact solution, I will then provide an approximate value.
Let's start by interpreting the mathematical expression from the image.
Error analyzing
It looks like I encountered an error because I forgot to import the sympy module before using it to convert the expression to LaTeX syntax. I will correct this and then proceed with the calculation again. 
There appears to be a mistake in the computation, as the result obtained is zero for both the exact solution and the approximate value, which is unlikely to be correct for the given expression.
I'll review the expression and recalculate to ensure accuracy. Let's transcribe the mathematical expression from the image into LaTeX syntax first and then solve it correctly. 
After correcting the calculations, here are the requested details:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \left( x + \frac{\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \sin \left( \frac{x \pi}{2} \right) \right)}{2} \right) \right)
#solution: \sqrt{2}/2
