It seems there was an issue with extracting the text from the image using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). This can happen if the image contains complex elements or formatting that OCR cannot interpret correctly.
I will instead manually transcribe the mathematical expression from the image and proceed to calculate the exact solution and its approximate value.
From the image, the mathematical expression is:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
π
(sin(4πx)+cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)))
I will now calculate the exact solution and an approximate value for this expression. 
The exact solution for the given mathematical expression is 
5 and the approximate value is also 
5.0.
Here are the requested values in the specified format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \sin(4\pi x) + \cos \left( \frac{\pi \sin(\frac{\pi x}{2})}{2} \right) \right) \right)
#solution: 5
#evalf_value: 5.0
