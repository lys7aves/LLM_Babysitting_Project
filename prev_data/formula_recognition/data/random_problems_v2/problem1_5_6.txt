To solve the problem shown in the image, I will perform the following steps:
Transcribe the mathematical expression from the image into LaTeX syntax.
Solve the mathematical expression to get the exact solution.
Calculate an approximate value of the solution.
Let's start by transcribing the expression into LaTeX.
Error analyzing
There was an error in the code because I mistakenly referenced sympy without importing it. Let me correct this and try again to transcribe the expression into LaTeX, solve it for the exact solution, and calculate an approximate value. 
Error analyzing
I made a mistake by referencing variables that were not yet defined due to the previous error. I'll correct this by running the entire process again in a single code block to ensure all variables are correctly defined and accessed. Let's transcribe the expression into LaTeX, solve it for the exact solution, and calculate an approximate value now. 
I realized I have not yet interpreted the mathematical expression from the image. I will do that first to ensure I have the correct expression before proceeding to solve it. Let me analyze the image and provide the correct LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and the approximate value. 
The optical character recognition (OCR) output is not clear and does not directly provide a usable LaTeX syntax. To proceed accurately, I will manually inspect and interpret the mathematical expression from the image. Once I've done that, I'll provide the LaTeX representation, solve for the exact value, and calculate an approximate value. Please give me a moment to do this. 
The result I obtained is not consistent with the complexity of the expression in the image. It seems there was an error in the manual interpretation of the expression. I will re-evaluate the image to ensure the correct interpretation. Please bear with me as I make the necessary adjustments. 
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax, its exact solution, and an approximate value are as follows:
