It seems there was an error while attempting to process the image using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). I will proceed by interpreting the mathematical expression manually.
The expression in the image appears to be a summation, specifically:
x=1
∑
10
2
πsin(
2
10
x
π
)
Now, I will compute the exact solution for this summation and provide an approximate value for it.

There seems to be a technical issue with executing the code to calculate the exact and approximate values of the mathematical expression. However, I can explain how you would typically solve this problem:
The mathematical expression in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
x=1
∑
10
2
πsin(
2
10
x
π
)
To find the exact solution, you would input this expression into a symbolic computation tool like Sympy or Mathematica, which can handle symbolic summation.
For the approximate value, after finding the exact solution, you would evaluate the expression to a floating-point number.
Since the execution environment is not currently working, you may use any symbolic computation software at your disposal to solve this expression. The steps would be the same: define the expression, perform the summation, and then evaluate it to get the approximate value.
I apologize for the inconvenience, and if the system is restored, I can attempt to calculate it again for you.
