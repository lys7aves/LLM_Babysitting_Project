It seems there is an issue with the execution of the code to solve the mathematical expression. However, I can still provide you with the LaTeX representation of the expression based on the image you've provided.
The LaTeX syntax for the expression in the image is:

Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin^{\left(\frac{\pi x \cos\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)}{2}\right)} x
Unfortunately, I'm currently unable to calculate the exact solution and its approximate value due to the technical issue. Normally, I would use a symbolic computation library like SymPy in Python to evaluate such expressions. If you have access to a mathematical software or programming environment that can handle symbolic
