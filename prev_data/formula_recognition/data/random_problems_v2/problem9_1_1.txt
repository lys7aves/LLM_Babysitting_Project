It seems there is a technical issue preventing the calculation from being executed. However, I can provide you with the LaTeX representation of the given expression and explain how to approach the solution manually.
The LaTeX syntax for the given mathematical expression is:

Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( \frac{1}{4x} \right) \cos^2\left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)
To solve this expression manually, you would need to evaluate the cosine term for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10, square it, and then divide by 
4x. This can be a bit tricky because the cosine term will be zero for all even values of 
x, due to the 
2
Ï€x
 term, which means those terms won't contribute to the sum.
Given that the internal calculation tool is not currently working, you
