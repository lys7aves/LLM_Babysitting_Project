Error analyzing
It appears there's a technical issue preventing me from calculating the solution directly. However, I can provide you with the method to solve this on your own:
The LaTeX representation of the expression from the image is:
∑
x=1
10
2
−8x
To solve this, you can use the geometric series sum formula, since 
2
−8x
 is a geometric progression with the common ratio 
r=2
−8
. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated with the formula:
S=
1−r
a(1−r
n
)
where:
S is the sum of the series,
a is the first term of the series,
r is the common ratio, and
n is the number of terms.
For the exact solution, you would substitute 
a=2
−8
, 
r=2
−8
, and 
n=10 into the formula.
