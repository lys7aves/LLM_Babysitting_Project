It appears there was an issue with performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the image you provided. However, based on the image, I will manually transcribe the mathematical expression and then solve the problem.
The mathematical expression in the image is a summation from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of the term 
2
−8x
.
Let's solve this problem step by step:
Transcribe the mathematical expression into LaTeX syntax.
Calculate the exact solution, which in this case is the sum of the series.
Find the approximate decimal value of the solution.
I will now calculate the exact and approximate values of the given expression.

There seems to be an issue with the calculation tool right now. However, I can guide you on how to perform the calculation yourself.
Given the summation:
x=1
∑
10
2
−8x
You can calculate this sum by hand or using a computer algebra system like Python with SymPy, or even a scientific calculator that supports summation and powers.
The exact solution is the sum of the geometric series, which can be found using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:
S=a⋅
1−r
1−r
n
where:
a is the first term of the series,
r is the common ratio,
n is the number of terms.
In this case:
a=2
−8
,
r=2
−8
,
n=10.
So the exact solution 
S would be:
S=2
−8
⋅
1−2
−8
1−(2
−8
)
10
And the approximate value can be found by calculating the above expression using a calculator.
Once you have the exact solution, you can often find the approximate value using a calculator or a software tool that can evaluate mathematical expressions to decimal form.
I apologize for the inconvenience. If you can use a computational tool on your side, you can input the above formula to find the exact and approximate values. If you need further assistance, please let me know!
