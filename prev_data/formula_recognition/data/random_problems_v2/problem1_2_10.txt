The interpretation of the mathematical expression from the image seems to have resulted in a value of 0 for both the exact and approximate solutions. This outcome is mathematically plausible if the terms in the summation result in 0 when evaluated. However, given the complexity of the expression involving nested trigonometric functions, there is a possibility of an error in the interpretation of the image.
Let's try interpreting the image again to ensure that the mathematical expression is accurately represented.
I will analyze the image once more to ensure that the expression is correctly interpreted. 
Error analyzing
It seems there is an issue with parsing the LaTeX expression due to the lack of a required package in this environment. However, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and calculate the solution.
The mathematical expression in the image appears to be a summation involving trigonometric functions. It looks like this in LaTeX syntax:
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πx
)sin(
2
πsin(
2
10
x
π
)
)
Given the previous attempt resulted in an output of zero, which is unexpected for such an expression, I'll manually compute the value of each term in the summation for 
x from 1 to 10 and provide the correct exact and approximate values. Let's proceed with this calculation. 
The manual computation of the summation for each term from 
x=1 to 
x=10 still results in an exact solution of 0, which also means the approximate value is 0. This suggests that each term in the summation might be evaluating to 0 due to the properties of the sine function, especially since the sine of a multiple of 
π is 0, and the summation involves the sine of 
π times an integer divided by 2.
To ensure this is correct, I'll manually check a few individual terms of the summation to confirm that they do indeed evaluate to 0.
Let's verify the first few terms explicitly: 
Upon evaluating the individual terms of the summation, it is confirmed that each term indeed evaluates to 0. This is consistent with the properties of the sine function, where 
sin(nπ)=0 for any integer 
n.
Therefore, the results are:
#problem: 
∑
