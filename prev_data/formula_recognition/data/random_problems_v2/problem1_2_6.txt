The OCR process did not yield any text from the image. I will instead manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image. Please bear with me for a moment. 
The mathematical expression represented in the image appears to be a summation, but the OCR did not pick up any recognizable characters. Given this, I will manually transcribe the expression based on what I see:
The LaTeX representation of the expression seems to be:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
x
π
)
Now, I will calculate the exact solution and an approximate value for this expression. Let's proceed with the calculations.
The LaTeX representation of the expression from the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
x
π
)
The exact solution involves complex numbers, which suggests that there might be an error since the sine of a real number should also be real. The result I obtained is:
#solution: 1 - (-1)^{513/1024} - (-1)^{257/512} - (-1)^{129/256} - (-1)^{65/128} - (-1)^{33/64} - (-1)^{17/32} - (-1)^{9/16} - (-1)^{5/8} - (-1)^{3/4}
The approximate value (which is complex) is:
#evalf_value: 2.4779819584455 - 8.60535176660596i
This complex result indicates there may have been a mistake in the interpretation of the image or in the calculation. Typically, the sine function applied to real arguments should yield real results. Would you like me to re-evaluate the image or check for any possible errors in the transcription?
