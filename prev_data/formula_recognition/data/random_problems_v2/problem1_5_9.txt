The OCR has not produced a useful output; it has returned fragmented text that does not resemble the mathematical expression in the image. This suggests that the OCR is having difficulty interpreting the mathematical symbols.
I will visually inspect the image and transcribe the mathematical expression manually. Let me take a closer look at the image to write down the expression in LaTeX format, solve the problem, and provide an approximate value of the solution. 
The mathematical expression from the image, represented in LaTeX syntax, is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)
The exact solution for this sum is:
#solution: 1
And the approximate value is:
#evalf_value: 1.0
