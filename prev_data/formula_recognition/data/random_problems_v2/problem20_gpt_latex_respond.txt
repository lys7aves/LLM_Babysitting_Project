It seems that there is an issue with the execution of the code to solve the mathematical expression. Despite this, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and provide you with the LaTeX representation, and then I will attempt to calculate the solution and approximate value again.
The expression in the image appears to be the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
sin(πsin(
2
9−6x
π)).
The LaTeX syntax for this expression would be:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\pi \sin\left(\frac{9 - 6x
