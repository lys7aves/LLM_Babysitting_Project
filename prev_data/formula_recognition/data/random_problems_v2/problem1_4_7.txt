The OCR output isn't clear and has not provided a usable interpretation of the mathematical expression from the image. Since the OCR result isn't accurate, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and then solve it.
Let me first analyze the mathematical expression from the image manually. 
The mathematical expression from the image is a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is 
sin(
2
Ï€x
), and the denominator is 
2
8x
.
To represent this expression in LaTeX syntax, solve for the exact solution, and then find an approximate value, I will perform the following steps:
Write down the LaTeX representation of the expression.
Calculate the exact solution using Python's symbolic math library sympy.
Find the approximate value to a high precision.
Let's start by writing the LaTeX representation.
