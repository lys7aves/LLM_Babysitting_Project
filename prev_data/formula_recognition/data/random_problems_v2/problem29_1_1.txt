The OCR has returned text that appears to be a partial and scrambled extraction from the image: '10', '7m sin', 'y sin', 'z=1', '2'. This output is not sufficient to accurately reconstruct the mathematical expression.
Since the OCR output is not clear, I will analyze the image directly to interpret the mathematical expression. Let's proceed with that. 
The expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{7\pi \sin(x)}{2^{\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}}}\right)
The exact solution is a symbolic sum of the sine values, which does not simplify to a simple fraction due to the nature of the sine and cosine functions involved:
#solution: \sin(7\pi\sin(5)) + \sin(7\pi\sin(1)) + \sin(7\pi\sin(3)) + \sin(7\cdot 2^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\pi\sin(2)) + \sin(7\pi\sin(9)) + \sin(7\cdot 2^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\pi\sin(6)) + \sin(7\cdot 2^{-\frac{\pi}{2}}\pi\sin(4)) + \sin(7\cdot 2^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\pi\sin(10)) + \sin(7\cdot 2^{-\frac{\pi}{2}}\pi\sin(8)) + \sin(7\pi\sin(7))
The approximate numerical value of this sum is:
#evalf_value: 3.38934494864731
Please note that the exact solution involves irrational numbers and cannot be represented as a simple fraction. The sum of the sine values depends on the irrational numbers pi and e (since 2 is the base of the natural logarithm and appears in the exponent).
