The OCR did not yield any results from the image. I'll analyze the image directly and manually transcribe the mathematical expression, solve the problem, and provide an approximate value for the solution.
Let's start by examining the image and transcribing the mathematical expression into LaTeX syntax. 
The mathematical expression in the image is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πsin(
2
10xπ
)
)
To solve this, I'll evaluate the expression for each 
x from 1 to 10, sum the results, and then provide an approximate decimal value for the sum.
Let's proceed with the calculation.
After evaluating the given expression, the exact sum is 
0, which means that the approximate value is also 
0.0.
Here are the results in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{\pi \sin \left( \frac{10x\pi}{2} \right)}{2} \right)
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0.0
