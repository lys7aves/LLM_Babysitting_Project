It seems that there's an issue with executing the code to solve the problem at the moment. However, I can provide you with the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression in the image and guide you on how to solve it.
The LaTeX syntax for the expression in the image is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
To solve this problem, you would need to compute the sum of the function for each integer value of 
x from 1 to 10. Since the exact computation is not currently possible due to technical limitations, you may use a scientific calculator or a mathematics software like SymPy in Python to calculate the exact and approximate values.
Once you have the software ready, you can run the following Python code using SymPy:
python
Copy code
from sympy import symbols, summation, sin, cos, pi

# Define the symbol
x = symbols('x')

# Define the expression as given in the image
expr = sin(pi*x/2)*sin(pi*cos(pi*x/2)/2)

# Calculate the summation of the expression from x=1 to x=10
sum_expr = summation(expr, (x, 1, 10))

# Get the exact solu
