The OCR process did not yield any readable text from the image, which is not unexpected for mathematical expressions since they often contain symbols and structures that are difficult for OCR software to interpret correctly.
I will analyze the image myself and provide you with the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let's start by interpreting the mathematical expression from the image. 
The mathematical expression from the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
xπ
+sin(
2
10
x
π
))
To find the exact solution and an approximate value, we need to evaluate this sum. This requires calculating the sine of an argument that includes sine itself, which typically cannot be simplified algebraically in a straightforward manner. However, we can compute this numerically.
Let's proceed with the calculation.
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression from the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
xπ
+sin(
2
10
x
π
))
The exact solution as a floating-point number is:
#solution: 1.0000011002512699
And the approximate value, rounded to 15 decimal places, is:
#evalf_value: 1.00000110025127
