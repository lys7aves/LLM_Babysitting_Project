The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as seen in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
The exact solution for the summation is:
#solution: -1
The approximate value of the summation is:
#evalf_value: -1.0
It appears that the summation of this trigonometric series results in -1. This suggests that the series converges to a single value rather than being an ongoing series.
