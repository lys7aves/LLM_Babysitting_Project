The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as seen in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \pi \sin{\left(\frac{10^{x} \pi}{2} \right)} \sin{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}
The exact solution for the expression is:
#solution: 0
The approximate value (evaluated floating-point value) is:
#evalf_value: 0
The expression simplifies to 0 because the sine of a multiple of 
Ï€ is 0, which occurs for several terms in the sum.
