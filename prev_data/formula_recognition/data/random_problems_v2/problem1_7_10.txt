The OCR result from the image does not provide a coherent mathematical expression. I will interpret the expression visually and manually transcribe it into LaTeX syntax, calculate the exact solution, and provide an approximate value.
Please give me a moment to process the image. 
The mathematical expression from the image, represented in LaTeX syntax, is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{x} + \frac{\pi \sin\left(\frac{10x\pi}{2}\right)}{2} \right)
The exact solution is a sum of sine functions with various powers of 
Ï€ as their arguments, which is not simplifiable to a standard fraction:
#solution: \sin\left(\frac{\pi^7}{128}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi^3}{8}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi^8}{256}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi^{10}}{1024}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi^4}{16}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi^5}{32}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi^2}{4}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi^6}{64}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi^9}{512}\right) + 1
And the approximate value is:
#evalf_value: 0.318719346342623
Please note that the exact solution provided here is the direct output of the symbolic computation and cannot be simplified further into a single fraction or a simpler form due to the nature of the sine function and the irrational numbers involved.
