The OCR has not provided a clear transcription of the mathematical expression from the image. I will manually interpret the image and then proceed to calculate the exact and approximate solutions.
First, let's transcribe the expression into LaTeX and then compute the solution. 
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression from the image is as follows:
#problem: \sum_{{x=1}}^{{10}} \sin\left(\frac{{\pi x}}{{2}} \sin\left(\frac{{\pi x^2}}{{2}}\right)\right)
The exact solution for the summation is:
#solution: 1
And the approximate value of this summation is:
#evalf_value: 1.0
