The OCR process did not yield any usable output from the image. Instead, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression in the image to provide the information you requested. Let's proceed with analyzing the image to extract the expression. 
Upon manual inspection, the expression in the image appears to be a sum from 
x=1 to 
10 with a function involving sine and powers of 2. However, due to the complex layout and the overlapping elements, it is difficult to make out the exact expression. I will attempt to provide a best guess interpretation of the mathematical expression.
Given the complexity and ambiguity in the image, the most accurate approach to resolve the expression would be to use mathematical knowledge to reconstruct the likely expression based on the visible elements. This process may involve making reasonable assumptions about the standard forms of mathematical expressions and typical usage of symbols.
I will now attempt to reconstruct the expression using this method and then provide a LaTeX representation, exact solution, and approximate value as requested.
Based on a best guess interpretation of the expression in the image, I have the following values:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
2
−8x
#solution: 4740885567116192841985/1208925819614629174706176
#evalf_value: 0.00392156862745098
Please note that the actual expression might differ since the interpretation was made with limited visual information. If you have more details or a clearer image, that would help in providing a more accurate solution.
