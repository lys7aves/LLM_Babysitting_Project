It seems that the OCR was not able to extract the text from the image correctly. I will proceed to interpret the expression manually and provide the LaTeX representation, exact solution, and approximate value as requested.
The LaTeX for the expression in the image would be:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos \left( \frac{9\pi (x \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}(x - \frac{7}{2})))}{2} \right)^x
Now, let's calculate the exact and approximate values of this expression. 
The LaTeX representation of the expression from the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos \left( \frac{9\pi (x \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}(x - \frac{7}{2})))}{2} \right)^x
The exact solution for the sum is a combination of cosine values raised to different powers, which does not simplify to a rational number easily. Therefore, I'm providing the unsimplified sum:
#solution: \cos\left(\frac{9\sqrt{2}\pi}{4}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{81\pi\sin(0.75\pi)}{2}\right)^9 + \cos\left(18\sqrt{2}\pi\right)^8 + \cos\left(\frac{27\sqrt{2}\pi}{4}\right)^3 + \cos\left(\frac{63\pi\sin(1.75\pi)}{2}\right)^7 + \cos\left(9\pi\sin(0.75\pi)\right)^2 + \cos\left(\frac{45\sqrt{2}\pi}{2}\right)^10 + \cos\left(9\sqrt{2}\pi\right)^4 + \cos\left(\frac{27\sqrt{2}\pi}{2}\right)^6 + \cos\left(\frac{45\pi\sin(0.75\pi)}{2}\right)^5
The approximate value of the sum is:
