The OCR output is not perfectly clear, but it seems to indicate a mathematical expression involving a summation. I will interpret the output and the image to provide the LaTeX syntax, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
The OCR result has some recognizable parts which seem to correspond to a summation from x=1 to 10 of a sine function. There are elements that indicate division by 2 and multiplication by Ï€. However, given the inaccuracies in the OCR output, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and then provide the LaTeX syntax and proceed to solve the expression.
I will now interpret the expression from the image and convert it to LaTeX syntax. 
The tasks have been completed, and here are the requested values:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sin\left(\frac{10x\pi}{2}\right)}{2} \right) \right)
#solution: \sqrt{2}/2 + 1
#evalf_value: 1.70710678118655
The exact solution is given in symbolic form because the sine of a sine function does not simplify to a rational number or a simple expression that can be represented as a fraction of integers. The approximate value is a numerical representation of the exact symbolic solution.
