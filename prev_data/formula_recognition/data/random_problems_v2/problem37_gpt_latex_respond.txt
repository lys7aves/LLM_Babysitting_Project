It seems there's an issue with performing the calculation at the moment. However, I can provide you with the LaTeX syntax for the expression in the image and guide you on how to solve it.
The LaTeX syntax for the expression in the image is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} -6 \cos \left( \frac{\pi \sin \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}{2} \right)
To solve this problem, you would typically substitute the values of 
x from 1 to 10 into the expression, evaluate the cosine term, and then sum all the evaluated results. Since the function involves both sine and cosine terms with 
π, the resulting values for each term could either be 0 or 
±1 due to the properties of sine and cosine functions at specific mul
