The OCR did not detect any text from the image. Since OCR may not always accurately detect mathematical symbols, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image and provide the LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let me analyze the expression and calculate the required values. 
The mathematical expression from the image is represented in LaTeX syntax as:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
The exact solution for the summation is:
#solution: -1
And the approximate value is:
#evalf_value: -1.0
