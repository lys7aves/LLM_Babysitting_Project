The given image contains a complex mathematical expression involving nested trigonometric functions. The interpretation of the expression based on the image and the attempt to compute it resulted in 'nan', which typically indicates that the expression within the sum evaluates to a value that is not defined (such as a division by zero or a complex logarithm evaluated at a negative number).
Given this result, here is the information in the requested format:
#problem: Sum(sin(7pisin(x/(2sin(picos(pi*x/2)/2)))), (x, 1, 10))
#solution: nan
#evalf_value: nan
It's important to note that the interpretation of the exact mathematical expression from the image may not be accurate due to its complexity and potential ambiguity in the handwritten notation. If you can provide more clarity or context on the expression, I can attempt to solve it again.
