The OCR process did not yield a coherent mathematical expression from the image. I will manually interpret the expression in the image and provide you with the LaTeX syntax, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let's proceed with interpreting the mathematical expression from the image. 
The expression in the image appears to be complex, and OCR has not successfully extracted the text due to the presence of gridlines and the complexity of the mathematical notation. I will interpret the expression manually:
It seems to represent a summation with the index variable 
x ranging from 1 to 10. Within the summation, there is an expression that appears to be an exponentiation or a function involving 
x, and there may also be trigonometric functions involved.
Given the complexity and potential for misinterpretation of mathematical expressions from images, especially with the presence of gridlines that can interfere with the recognition of symbols, manual interpretation is crucial for accuracy. I will interpret the image and provide you with the LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and an approximate value as you requested. Let's start by determining the LaTeX code.
Based on my interpretation of the image, the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{\sin(\frac{\pi}{2} x)}{\pi + \frac{\pi \sin(\frac{10^x \pi}{2})}{2}}
The exact solution is:
#solution: \frac{1}{\pi}
And the approximate value is:
#evalf_value: 0.318309886183791
Please note that this interpretation is based on a visual assessment of the image and the actual expression may differ if there are details in the image that were not captured correctly.
