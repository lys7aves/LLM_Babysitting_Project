The OCR result is not clear enough to accurately interpret the mathematical expression. I will manually analyze the image to provide the LaTeX representation of the expression, solve it, and give an approximate value.
Let's proceed with the manual analysis. 
The mathematical expression in the image is a summation. Given the OCR's output and the visual inspection of the image, the expression seems to be the sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of a function that involves 
sin and possibly a power of 2.
The OCR output is not accurate enough to determine the exact function, but we can interpret the pattern in the image. The LaTeX representation will include the summation symbol 
Σ, the limits of the summation, and the expression inside the summation.
However, without an accurate OCR result, the exact LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and the approximate value cannot be confidently determined. The OCR has misinterpreted the mathematical symbols, likely due to the complexity of the expression and the presence of gridlines.
To proceed accurately, I would need to transcribe the expression based on my interpretation of the image. Let's do this now.
Based on the visual inspection, the mathematical expression appears to be:
x=1
∑
10
2
sin(
2
πsin(
2
10xπ
)
)
To solve this expression, we'll calculate the exact value of the sum as well as an approximate value in decimal form.
Let's proceed with the calculation.
The exact solution of the summation is 
0, and the approximate decimal value is also 
0.
Here are the details in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi \sin(\frac{10x\pi}{2})}{2}\right)}{2}
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0
It's worth noting that the result suggests that for each term of the summation, the sine function results in a value that causes the entire term to be zero. This could happen if the inner sine function always results in a multiple of 
π, which sine would then convert to 
0, making the entire expression 
0 for each term in the summation.
