It seems that the OCR process was not able to extract text from the image. I will manually interpret the mathematical expression and solve it.
The expression in the image is a summation as follows:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πx
)sin(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
)
I will calculate the exact solution and its approximate value now. 
The exact solution of the summation is 
0, and the approximate value is also 
0.0.
Here are the details in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0.0
