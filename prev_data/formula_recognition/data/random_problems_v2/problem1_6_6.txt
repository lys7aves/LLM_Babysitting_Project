The image provided appears to show a mathematical expression, and to solve it, I will interpret the expression and calculate the exact solution along with its approximate value.
First, let's transcribe the mathematical expression from the image into LaTeX syntax. Once that's done, I'll solve the problem using Python, which can handle symbolic mathematics and provide both the exact solution and an approximate value.
Let's start by interpreting the mathematical expression.
The mathematical expression represented in the image and its corresponding LaTeX syntax is as follows:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
(sin(
2
πx
)+sin(
2
π10
x
))
The exact solution for this expression is:
#solution: 1
And the approximate value (to 15 decimal places) is:
#evalf_value: 1.000000000000000
