Error analyzing
There seems to be an internal error that occurred while trying to process your request. However, I can still provide you with the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression and solve it manually.
The LaTeX syntax for the summation expression in the image is:
x=1
∑
10
−9x
To solve this, we calculate the sum of the sequence 
−9x where 
x ranges from 1 to 10:
−9⋅1+(−9⋅2)+(−9⋅3)+…+(−9⋅10)
This is an arithmetic series where the first term 
a
1
=−9, the common difference 
d=−9, and the number of terms 
n=10.
The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:
S
n
=
2
n
[2a
1
+(n−1)d]
Plugging in our values:
S
10
=
2
10
[2(−9)+(10−1)(−9)]
S
S

=5[−18−81]
S
S

=5[−99]
S
S

=−495
So the exact solution is -495, a
