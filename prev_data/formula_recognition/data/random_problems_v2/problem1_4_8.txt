It seems there was an error in attempting to read the text from the image using OCR. I will manually interpret the mathematical expression and provide the LaTeX representation, exact solution, and an approximate value for the expression shown in the image.
The LaTeX representation of the expression in the image is as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}^{\sin(\pi x)}\right)
Now I will calculate the exact solution and its approximate value. 
The exact solution and approximate value for the given expression are:
#solution: 
10sin(1)
#evalf_value: 
8.41470984807897
However, there may be a discrepancy between the interpreted LaTeX expression and the one in the image since OCR did not successfully extract the text. If the LaTeX expression I provided is incorrect, please let me know the correct expression, and I will recalculate the solution and approximate value.
