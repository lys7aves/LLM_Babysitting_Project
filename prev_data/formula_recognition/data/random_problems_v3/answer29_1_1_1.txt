It appears that the evaluation of the mathematical expression as interpreted from the image results in the summation being zero. Here are the details:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \sin \left( \pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} x \right) \right) \right) \right) \right) \right)
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0
This indicates that the summation of the given function from 
x=1 to 
x=10 is exactly and approximately 0.
