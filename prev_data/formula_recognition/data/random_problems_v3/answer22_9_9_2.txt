The OCR result for the mathematical expression from the image is not complete and seems to have errors. However, based on my understanding of mathematical expressions and common LaTeX syntax, I will attempt to interpret the expression from the images and provide you with the LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and an approximate value.
Given the incomplete OCR result and the common structure of such expressions, the expression seems to be a sum involving sine functions and possibly a fraction or power series. I will analyze the image directly to determine the correct LaTeX expression. Let's proceed with that. 
The OCR process has detected a few elements with high confidence: "7", "2", and the symbol "|". This information is still not enough to reconstruct the complete mathematical expression accurately. Since the OCR is not yielding a full and clear result, I will manually transcribe the expression based on the image into LaTeX syntax, solve it, and provide the approximate value as well.
Please allow me a moment to analyze and transcribe the expression. 
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression, its exact solution, and an approximate decimal value cannot be directly extracted using OCR due to the complexity of the expression and limitations of the OCR technology for such tasks.
I will manually transcribe the expression from the image into LaTeX. Then, I will proceed to calculate the exact solution and an approximate decimal value for the expression. Let's begin with the transcription of the LaTeX representation.
The LaTeX representation of the expression based on my analysis is:
latex
Copy code
\left[
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( 4 \pi \sin \left( 
\frac{\pi \sin \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}{2} \right)}{2} \right)}{2} \right) 
\right)
\right]^{-2}
Now, I will attempt to compute the exact solution and an approximate decimal value for this expression. Since the expression involves nested trigonometric functions, it's not straightforward to simplify it algebraically. Therefore, I'll use numerical methods to evaluate it. Let's proceed with that. 
Error analyzing
It appears that the final expression is being evaluated to a complex number, which cannot be directly converted to a float. This suggests that there might be an issue with the interpretation of the expression, as the trigonometric functions involved should not produce a complex number when evaluated over real numbers.
Given this complexity and the limitations of automated tools for interpreting such intricate mathematical expressions, I recommend checking the expression manually to ensure that it is transcribed correctly and to resolve any possible errors. If you have a clear image of the expression or additional context that could help in interpreting it correctly, please provide that, and I will attempt to resolve the expression again.
In the meantime, I will provide you with the LaTeX expression that I interpreted:
#problem:
latex
Copy code
\left[
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( 4 \pi \sin \left( 
\frac{\pi \sin \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}{2} \right)}{2} \right)}{2} \right) 
\right)
\right]^{-2}
Unfortunately, without the correct interpretation of the expression, I am unable to provide the #solution and #evalf_value at this time.
