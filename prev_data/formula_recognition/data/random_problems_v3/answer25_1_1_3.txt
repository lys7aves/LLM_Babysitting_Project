Error analyzing
It appears there was a mistake in interpreting the expression. The result provided seems to be for a different or incorrect expression. I'll re-evaluate the original expression from the image to ensure we get the correct LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and approximate value.
Let me analyze the image again and correct the process. 
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin^{\frac{\pi \sin{\left(\frac{\pi \sin{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}}{2} \right)}}{2}}{\left(x \right)}
The exact solution to this expression involves complex numbers, which indicates that the input may have been misinterpreted since the sum of sines raised to real powers should not result in complex numbers.
The exact solution is a symbolic expression involving sine terms raised to powers, and it is not simplified to a single fraction:
#solution: \sin(9)^{\frac{\pi}{2}} + \sin(1)^{\frac{\pi}{2}} + \sin(7)^{-\frac{\pi}{2}} + 5 + \sin(3)^{-\frac{\pi}{2}} + \sin(5)^{\frac{\pi}{2}}
The approximate value, which includes a complex component, likely due to an error in the interpretation of the expression, is:
#evalf_value: 29.8202838392183 - 0.913177823200183i
Given the unexpected result, I will reassess the image to ensure accuracy in interpreting the expression. 
Upon re-evaluation, the results obtained are consistent with the previous attempt, indicating that the interpretation of the expression from the image may indeed be correct. However, the presence of complex numbers is unusual for this kind of real-valued summation and may suggest an error in the mathematical interpretation of the image. Without the capacity to validate the visual information against the calculated result, I can only provide the derived values as obtained.
Here are the details as per the analysis:
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin^{\frac{\pi \sin{\left(\frac{\pi \sin{\left(\frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}}{2} \right)}}{2}}{(x)}
The exact symbolic solution is a sum of sine functions raised to various powers:
#solution: \sin(9)^{\frac{\pi}{2}} + \sin(1)^{\frac{\pi}{2}} + \sin(7)^{-\frac{\pi}{2}} + 5 + \sin(3)^{-\frac{\pi}{2}} + \sin(5)^{\frac{\pi}{2}}
The approximate value, which includes a complex number component, is:
#evalf_value: 29.8202838392183 - 0.913177823200183i
Given that the solution involves complex numbers, which should not be the case for the sum of real-valued sine functions to real powers, it is recommended to visually inspect the image or consult additional mathematical expertise to confirm the correct interpretation of the expression.
