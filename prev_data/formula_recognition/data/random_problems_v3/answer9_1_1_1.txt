The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \pi \left( x + \frac{3}{2} \right) \right)
The exact solution of this sum is:
#solution: 0
And the approximate (evaluated) value is:
#evalf_value: 0
The reason the sum evaluates to zero is that the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and because 
π(x+
2
3
) is an odd multiple of 
2
π
 for all integer values of x from 1 to 10, the sine of these values will be either 1 or -1, which cancels out over the sum.
