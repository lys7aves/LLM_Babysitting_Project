Error analyzing
It appears I attempted to use a function from the sympy library without importing it correctly. Let me correct that mistake and compute the LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and the approximate value of the given expression. I will first interpret the expression from the image accurately. Let me take another look at the image to transcribe the expression. 
The LaTeX representation of the expression from the image is as follows:
latex
Copy code
\frac{\pi \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) \sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos \left( \frac{9 \pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{x}{2} + \sin \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right) \right) \right) }{2} \right) + \frac{81}{2} }{2}
This LaTeX code should replicate the structure of the mathematical expression in the image. However, the exactitude of the LaTeX code depends on the accuracy of the visual interpretation of the image.
The next step is to solve this expression exactly and provide an approximate value. To proceed with solving, I need to ensure that my interpretation of the expression is correct. Let's analyze the components:
The summation indicates a series from x = 1 to 10.
Inside the summation, there is a cosine function that involves a nested cosine function.
The numerator includes the product of π, sin(π/2), and the summation term, plus 81/2.
This entire expression is divided by 2.
Given the complexity of the expression, solving it analytically might not be straightforward. I will attempt to calculate the exact and approximate solutions using symbolic computation. Let's proceed with that. 
The exact symbolic solution to the interpreted expression is:
latex
Copy code
\frac{\pi \left(5 \cos\left(\frac{9 \sqrt{2} \pi}{4}\right) + 3\right)}{2} + \frac{81}{4}
And the approximate numerical value of this expression is approximately 
18.3573655361869.
However, it's important to note that this solution is based on the interpretation of the mathematical expression from the image. If the interpretation is not correct, the solution would also be incorrect. It's recommended to verify the transcription of the expression to ensure accuracy.
