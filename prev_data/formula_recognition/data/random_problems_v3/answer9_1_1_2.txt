The mathematical expression represented in the image is a summation of the sine function, specifically:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\pi \left(x + \frac{3}{2}\right)\right)
After solving the expression, both the exact solution and the approximate value are:
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0
The sine function with a 
π multiplier for integer values of 
x will result in an output of zero, as sine of 
π times any integer is always zero. Since the summation is over integers from 1 to 10, each term of the summation is zero, hence the sum is also zero.
