The OCR result is not providing a clear transcription of the mathematical expression. Since OCR can struggle with the precise notation and formatting of mathematical expressions, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression from the image you provided and write it in LaTeX syntax, find the exact solution, and give an approximate value.
Please give me a moment to do this. 
Here are the requested values:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{3 \pi x \cos\left(\frac{\pi \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{7 \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right) - \pi}\right)}{2}
#solution: \frac{3 \pi (12 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{7 - \pi}\right) + 25 \cos(1) + 18 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{-7 - \pi}\right))}{2}
#evalf_value: 183.255555021933
Please note that the exact solution is expressed in terms of trigonometric functions of numeric and symbolic expressions. The cos(1) represents the cosine of 1 radian. The approximate value is a decimal representation of this exact solution.
