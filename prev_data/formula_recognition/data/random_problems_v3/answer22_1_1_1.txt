It appears that the summation of the given expression evaluates to 0, which is both the exact solution and its approximate value in floating point. This is likely because the expression within the summation has symmetrical properties over the specified range that cause it to sum to zero.
Here is the result in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{\sin(4\pi x)}{2^{\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}x)))}}
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0.0
