Error analyzing
There was a mistake in the code execution because the module sympy wasn't imported correctly. I will fix this and try again. 
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} (10 + x - 2x)
The exact solution of the summation is:
#solution: 45
The approximate value (which in this case is the same as the exact value since it's an integer) is:
#evalf_value: 45.0
