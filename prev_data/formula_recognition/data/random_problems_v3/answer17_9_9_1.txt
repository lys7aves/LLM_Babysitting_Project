Error analyzing
The provided images contain a mathematical expression which seems to have been misinterpreted by my initial attempt. The images show a complex fraction within a cosine function inside a summation. I'll need to carefully analyze the provided images again to extract the correct mathematical expression.
Let me take another look at the images to provide you with the accurate LaTeX representation, exact solution, and approximate value. 
The optical character recognition (OCR) process did not successfully interpret the mathematical expressions from the images. Given this result, I will manually transcribe the expression from the images you provided.
From the images, the expression appears to be a summation of a cosine function, where the argument of the cosine is a fraction involving 
π, sine, and 
x. However, due to the complexity and quality of the images, it is challenging to transcribe the expression with complete accuracy.
I will now manually transcribe the expression based on the provided images and then solve it. 
Based on the manual transcription of the mathematical expression from the images, the results are as follows:
