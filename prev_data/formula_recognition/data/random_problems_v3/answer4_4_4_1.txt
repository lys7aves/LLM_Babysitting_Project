The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression from the image is:
#problem: \sum_{{x=1}}^{{10}} \sin\left(\frac{{\pi \cos\left(\pi \left(x + \frac{{1}}{{2x^5}}\right)\right)}}{{2}}\right)
The exact solution for the sum is a summation of multiple sine functions with cosines in their arguments. It's a complex expression involving irrational numbers, so it cannot be simplified to a single fraction like the example you've given.
The approximate value of the sum is:
#evalf_value: 0.999998210529464
