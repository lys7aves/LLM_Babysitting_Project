Error analyzing
The attempt to use optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the mathematical expression from the images has taken too long and was interrupted. Instead, I will manually interpret the mathematical expression and provide you with the LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let's proceed with the interpretation. 
I will now analyze the image and manually transcribe the mathematical expression into LaTeX. Once the LaTeX transcription is complete, I'll calculate the exact solution and its approximate value. Please hold on while I work on this.
The expression in the image is complex, involving summation, trigonometric functions, and fraction operations. I will transcribe it into LaTeX syntax and then perform the necessary calculations to provide the exact solution and its approximate value. Please give me a moment to do this. 
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
(−9cos(
2
πcos(πx+sin(
2
πx
))
)+
2
81
)
The exact solution is a symbolic expression since it involves the cosine of an expression which is not a standard angle. The symbolic exact solution is:
#solution: 
405−45cos(
2
πcos(1)
)
The approximate value of the expression when evaluated numerically is:
#evalf_value: 375.257 (rounded to three decimal places)
Please note that the exact solution is given in terms of a cosine function of a non-standard angle, which generally cannot be simplified to a rational number or a simple expression involving 
π. Therefore, the "exact" solution remains in a symbolic form. The approximate value provided is the numerical approximation of this symbolic result.
