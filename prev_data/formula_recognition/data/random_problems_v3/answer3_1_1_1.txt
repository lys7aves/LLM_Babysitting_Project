The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} (-3x^2 + x)
The exact solution to the summation is:
#solution: -1100
The approximate value (which in this case is the same as the exact value because the solution is an integer) is:
#evalf_value: -1100.0
