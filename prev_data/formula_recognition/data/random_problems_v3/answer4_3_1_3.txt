It seems there was an internal error when attempting to process the mathematical expression. Let's try that again.

Unfortunately, there appears to be a persistent issue with processing the mathematical expression. While I am unable to calculate the exact and approximate values at this moment, I can provide you with the LaTeX representation of the expression you provided.
The LaTeX syntax for the given mathematical expression is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \pi \left( x + \frac{1}{2x^{5}} \right) \right)}{2} \right)
For the exact solution and the approximate value, you may consider using a mathematical software or an online tool capable of symbolic computation, such as Wolfram Alpha or a Python environment with SymPy library, which is what I attempted to use. Here is how you would typically solve it using SymPy in Python:
python
Copy code
from sympy import symbols, sin, cos, pi, summation

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Define the expression given in the image
expr = sin(pi * cos(pi * (x + 1/(2*x**5))) / 2)

# Perform the summation from x=1 to x=10
solution = summation(expr, (x, 1, 10))

# Evaluate the expression to a numerical (floating-point) value
evalf_value = solution.evalf()

# Then you would print out or use the solution and evalf_value as needed
If you have access to Python and the SymPy library, you can run the code above to obtain the exact solution and the approximate value. If not, I recommend using a dedicated mathematics tool for these calculations.
