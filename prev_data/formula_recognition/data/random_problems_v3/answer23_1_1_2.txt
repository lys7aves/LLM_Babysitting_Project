The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as seen in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \pi \left( \cos \left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right) + \frac{7}{2} \right) \right)
The exact solution of the summation is:
#solution: 0
The approximate value is:
#evalf_value: 0
Since the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and the argument of the sine function in the given expression always results in a multiple of 
Ï€ (which sine evaluates to 0), the summation of the entire expression over the range given is 0.
