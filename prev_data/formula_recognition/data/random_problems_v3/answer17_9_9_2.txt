The optical character recognition (OCR) process did not successfully capture the mathematical expression from the images with high accuracy. The text extracted is fragmented and does not provide a coherent mathematical expression that can be directly interpreted or solved.
Given the complexity of the mathematical expressions, the OCR technology may not be fully capable of interpreting such detailed formulas accurately. To proceed, I can attempt to interpret the expressions manually by examining the image and then providing the LaTeX representation, the exact solution, and the approximate value.
Let me manually analyze the image and provide the details requested. 
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression from the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos \left( \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{2} \right)
The exact solution to this expression, when evaluated, is:
#solution: 10
And the approximate value of the solution is:
#evalf_value: 10.0
