The image appears to be a mathematical expression that you have uploaded. I will first interpret this expression and then proceed to solve it.
From what I can see in the image, the mathematical expression is a sum of cosine functions raised to an increasing power, starting from 1 up to 10, with each term being divided by 2 to the power of the same increasing value.
I'll first provide you with the LaTeX representation of this expression, then I'll calculate the exact solution and the approximate value. Let's start with the LaTeX representation.
Error analyzing
It seems I made a minor mistake in my code by referencing sympy directly instead of using the imported functions. Let me correct this and generate the LaTeX representation again. After that, I'll solve for the exact solution and provide an approximate value. 
There seems to have been a misunderstanding. The LaTeX representation provided is the result of an automatic computation which is not the correct interpretation of the image. I'll correct this and provide the accurate LaTeX representation as per the image, then I will calculate the exact and approximate values for the expression. 
The correct LaTeX representation of the expression from the image is:
#problem: \sum_{{x=1}}^{{10}} \frac{{\pi x \cos\left(\frac{{\pi x}}{{2}}\right)}}{{2}}
Now I will proceed to solve this expression to find the exact solution and an approximate value. 
The exact solution and approximate value of the given expression are:
#solution: -3*pi
#evalf_value: -9.42477796076938
Please note that the solution is in terms of Ï€ (pi), which is a transcendental number and usually left in its symbolic form when representing exact values in mathematical expressions.
