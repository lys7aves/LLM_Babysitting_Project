It seems that the OCR process did not yield any text from the image. I'll proceed by interpreting the mathematical expression directly from the image and then solve it.
From the image, the mathematical expression can be interpreted as:
x=1
∑
10
cos(
2
πsin(π(
2
x
+
2
3
))
)
I will now calculate the exact and approximate values of this expression. 
The solution for the given mathematical expression is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos\left(\frac{\pi \sin\left(\pi \left(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{3}{2}\right)\right)}{2}\right)
#solution: 5
#evalf_value: 5.00000000000000
