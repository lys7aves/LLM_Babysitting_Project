Error analyzing
It seems there was an error while trying to read the mathematical expression from the image using OCR. I will instead interpret the expression visually and provide the LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and an approximate value.
Given the expression from the image:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πcos(π(x+
2x
5
1
))
)
I will now calculate the exact solution and its approximate value. 
Error analyzing
I encountered an internal error while trying to compute the exact solution and its approximate value using the system's Python environment. However, I can still provide you with the LaTeX representation of the expression as seen in the image:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\pi \left(x + \frac{1}{2x^5}\right)\right)}{2}\right)
For the exact solution and approximate value, I would recommend using a mathematical software or a calculator capable of symbolic computation, such as SymPy in Python or Mathematica. If you have access to such a tool, you can input the LaTeX expression provided, and the software should be able to give you the exact sum and its numerical approximation.
