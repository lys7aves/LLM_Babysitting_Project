It seems that the OCR was not successful in interpreting the mathematical expression from the image. I will instead visually inspect the image and provide the LaTeX representation, exact solution, and approximate value based on my analysis.
Based on the image you provided, the LaTeX for the mathematical expression is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos(\pi (x + \frac{5}{2}))}{2}\right)
To provide the exact solution and an approximate value, I will calculate the expression using Python. 
The calculation reveals that the sum of the given series is exactly 0, which also means the approximate value is 0.
Here are the values in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos(\pi (x + \frac{5}{2}))}{2}\right)
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0
