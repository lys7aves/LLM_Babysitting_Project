There seems to be an issue with parsing the LaTeX expression using the SymPy library, as the required module antlr4 is not installed in this environment. However, I can manually translate the LaTeX expression and calculate the exact and approximate values without relying on the LaTeX parsing feature.
The LaTeX expression from the image can be translated to SymPy's syntax manually, and then I can calculate the exact and approximate values for the summation. Let's proceed with that. 
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
The exact solution to this expression is:
#solution: 5
The approximate value of the solution is:
#evalf_value: 5.0
