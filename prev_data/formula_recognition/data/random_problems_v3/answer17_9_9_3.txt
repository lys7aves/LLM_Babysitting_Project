The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: 
∑
x=1
10
cos(
2
πx
πsin(
2
πx
)
)
The exact solution is a sum of cosine values at different points plus 5, because for 
x>5, the sine function will produce values that cause the cosine function to repeat its values due to periodicity:
#solution: 
cos(2)+cos(
3
2
)+cos(
5
2
)+cos(
7
2
)+cos(
9
2
)+5
The approximate value of the summation is:
