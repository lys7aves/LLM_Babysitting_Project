The image contains a mathematical expression that appears to be a summation. To provide you with the LaTeX representation of the expression, the exact solution, and an approximate value, I'll first need to interpret the expression correctly.
Once I have transcribed the expression into LaTeX, I will perform the calculation to obtain both the exact solution in the form of a fraction (if possible) and the decimal approximation.
Let me first write out the LaTeX code for the expression you've provided. After that, I'll proceed with the calculations.
The LaTeX syntax for the mathematical expression you provided is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin^{x} x \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}{2} \right)
The exact solution to this summation is:
latex
Copy code
\frac{\pi(-\sin(2)^2 - \sin(10)^{10} - \sin(6)^6 + \sin(4)^4 + \sin(8)^8)}{2}
This exact form indicates that the sum involves sinusoidal functions evaluated at integer multiples of 
Ï€, which usually results in a pattern or simplification, but in this case, given the powers, it remains complex.
The approximate value of this summation is:
Copy code
0.654149468381636
To summarize, here are your requested values:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin^{x} x \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}{2} \right)
#solution: \frac{\pi(-\sin(2)^2 - \sin(10)^{10} - \sin(6)^6 + \sin(4)^4 + \sin(8)^8)}{2}

Analyzing
The mathematical expression from the image can be represented in LaTeX as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin^x(x) \left( \frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2} \right)
The exact solution of the summation is a rather complex expression involving sines of even powers, which cannot be simplified to a nice fraction easily.
However, the approximate value of this summation is:
#evalf_value: 0.654149468381636
Please note that the exact solution involves irrational numbers and cannot be represented as a simple fraction.
