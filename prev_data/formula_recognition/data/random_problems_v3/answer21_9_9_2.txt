The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not yield any text from the images provided. This is likely due to the nature of the content (mathematical expressions) which can be difficult for OCR software to interpret accurately.
I'll proceed to interpret the mathematical expression manually from the image. Let's start by transcribing the LaTeX representation of the expression. Then, I will calculate the exact solution as well as an approximate value. 
The expression represented in LaTeX syntax as seen in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos\left(\frac{\pi \sin\left(\pi \left(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{3}{2}\right)\right)}{2}\right)
The exact solution is:
#solution: 5
The approximate value is:
#evalf_value: 5.0
