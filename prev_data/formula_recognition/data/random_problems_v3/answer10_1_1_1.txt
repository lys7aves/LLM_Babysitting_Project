It seems there was an error in the computation. The result returned is just the number 10, which is incorrect for the given expression. I will try the calculation again and provide you with the correct LaTeX syntax, exact solution, and the approximate value. Let's proceed with the correct calculation. 
Here are the results as requested:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{\cos(3\pi x)}{2^{\frac{\sin(\frac{\pi x}{2})}{7\cos(\frac{\pi x}{2})-\pi}}}
#solution: -3 \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{\pi}} - 2 \cdot 2^{-\frac{1}{\pi}} + 5
#evalf_value: -0.344624724624819
