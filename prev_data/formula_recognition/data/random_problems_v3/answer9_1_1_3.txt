The OCR process did not yield a readable result from the image of the mathematical expression. However, based on the image you've provided, I can manually interpret the mathematical expression.
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\pi\left(x + \frac{3}{2}\right)\right)
Now, I will calculate the exact solution and an approximate value for this expression. 
The solution for the given mathematical expression is exactly 0. This is because the sine of any integer multiple of 
π is 0. Since the expression inside the sine function is 
π times an integer for all values of 
x from 1 to 10, the sine function will always return 0.
Here are the values in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left(\pi\left(x + \frac{3}{2}\right)\right)
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0.0
