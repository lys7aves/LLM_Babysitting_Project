The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} (-3x^2 + x)
The exact solution to this summation is:
#solution: -1100
The approximate value, which is the same as the exact value in this case since it is an integer, is:
#evalf_value: -1100.00000000000
