Error analyzing
There was an error trying to parse the LaTeX expression using the available tools in this environment, which seem to be missing the necessary antlr4 package.
However, I can still attempt to solve the mathematical expression manually. The LaTeX expression as shown in the image would be represented as follows:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( \frac{1}{x^5} + (x^x) \right)
Now I will calculate the exact solution and its approximate value manually. 
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax is:
latex
Copy code
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( \frac{1}{x^5} + (x^x) \right)
The exact solution is:
latex
Copy code
#solution: \frac{1057420596074598591309357931}{101625502003200000}
And the approximate value is:
latex
Copy code
#evalf_value: 10405071318.0369
