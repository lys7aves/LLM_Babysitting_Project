The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{{x=1}}^{{10}} (-3x^2 + x)
The exact solution of the sum is:
#solution: -1100
And the approximate value (which in this case is the same as the exact value since it's an integer) is:
#evalf_value: -1100
