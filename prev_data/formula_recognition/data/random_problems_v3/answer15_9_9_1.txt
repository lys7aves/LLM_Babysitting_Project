The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression in the image is:
#problem: \sin\left(\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi (x + \frac{\pi}{2})}{2}\right)\right)
The exact solution, in terms of the sum of the sine of trigonometric expressions, is quite complex and involves multiple terms of sin and cos functions. However, the summation of these terms from 
x=1 to 
x=10 results in a numerical value.
The approximate numerical value of this summation is:
