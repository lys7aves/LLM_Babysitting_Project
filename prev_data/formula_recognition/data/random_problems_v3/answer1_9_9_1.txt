The OCR process did not successfully capture the entire mathematical expression from the image. Due to the complexity and formatting of mathematical notation, OCR technology may not always yield accurate results for such content.
Given this, I will manually transcribe the mathematical expression from the image and solve it. Let's proceed step by step to ensure accuracy.
First, I will interpret the mathematical expression and convert it into LaTeX syntax. Then I'll calculate the exact solution and its approximate value. Please hold on while I perform these steps. 
After viewing the image, I can provide the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression. However, to ensure accuracy, I will need to manually transcribe and solve the expression. This may take some time, so please bear with me as I work through the problem. Once I have the LaTeX syntax, I'll proceed with finding the exact solution and its approximate value. 
The LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression from the image is as follows:
#problem: \frac{\sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos \left( \frac{\pi \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) \pi}{9 \cos \left( \frac{\pi \cos \left( \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\sin \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right)}{2} \right)}{2} \right)} + \frac{81}{2} \right)}{2}
The exact solution is a complex symbolic expression involving cosine functions, and it cannot be further simplified to a simple fraction or integer:
#solution: 3cos(81/2 + pi^2/(9cos(picos(3)/2)))/2 + cos(pi^2/(9cos(picos(5)/2)) + 81/2) + 3cos(pi^2/(9cos(picos(1)/2)) + 81/2)/2 + cos(pi^2/(9cos(picos(2)/2)) + 81/2)/2 + cos(pi^2/(9cos(picos(4)/2)) + 81/2)/2
The approximate value of this expression, when evaluated numerically, is:
#evalf_value: -2.59526821099373
Please note that this evaluation is subject to the inherent limitations of numerical computations of trigonometric expressions which may have multiple interpretations depending on the context.
