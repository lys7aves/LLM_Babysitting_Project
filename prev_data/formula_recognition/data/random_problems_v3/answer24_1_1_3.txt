It appears that the OCR process did not yield any text from the image. This could be due to the format of the mathematical expression not being recognized properly by the OCR software. I will proceed to manually interpret the mathematical expression and solve it.
From the image, the LaTeX representation of the expression is:
x=1
∑
10
sin(π(
2
cos(
2
πx
)
+
2
7
))
Next, I will calculate the exact solution and its approximate value. 
The exact solution for the given mathematical expression is 
−5, and the approximate value is also 
−5.00000000000000.
Here are the requested values in the specified format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin\left( \pi \left( \frac{\cos(\frac{\pi x}{2})}{2} + \frac{7}{2} \right) \right)
#solution: -5
#evalf_value: -5.00000000000000
