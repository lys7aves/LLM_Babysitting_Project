The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax as written in the image is:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \sin \left( \pi \left( \cos \left( \frac{\pi x}{2} \right) + \frac{7}{2} \right) \right)
The exact solution for this summation is:
#solution: 0
And the approximate value, which is the same in this case because the exact solution is 0, is:
#evalf_value: 0
