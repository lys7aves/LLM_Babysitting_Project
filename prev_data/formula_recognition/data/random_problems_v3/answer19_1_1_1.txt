Error analyzing
It seems there was an error in interpreting the expression from the image. The provided output does not match the complexity of the expression in the image you uploaded. I will interpret the expression from the image and then proceed to solve it accordingly. Let's start by analyzing the image to extract the LaTeX representation of the mathematical expression it contains. 
The output from the optical character recognition (OCR) is not clear and seems to have errors, which is not uncommon when dealing with complex mathematical expressions. Given the limitations of OCR with such expressions, I will manually transcribe the expression from the image into LaTeX syntax.
From the image, the expression appears to be a summation that involves a cosine function raised to a power, with a fraction inside the cosine function, and the entire term is divided by 2. The LaTeX representation of the expression in the image is as follows:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \left(\frac{\pi x \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)^x
Now, I will calculate the exact solution and an approximate value for this expression. 
The exact solution for the mathematical expression from the image is a sum of terms with increasing powers of 
Ï€, and the approximate value is a large numerical result. Here are the details:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \left(\frac{\pi x \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)^x
#solution: \pi^{2} + 16 \pi^{4} + 729 \pi^{6} + 65536 \pi^{8} + 9765625 \pi^{10}
