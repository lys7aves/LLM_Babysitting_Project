Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue with parsing the LaTeX using the available libraries in this environment due to a missing dependency. However, I can still manually translate the expression into LaTeX and solve it using alternative methods.
Let's start by interpreting the LaTeX expression manually from the image:
The LaTeX for the expression in the image appears to be:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( \sin(4\pi x) - \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)}{2} \right)
Next, I'll calculate the solution and approximate value manually. 
The mathematical expression represented in LaTeX syntax is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( \sin(4\pi x) - \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)}{2} \right)
The exact solution to the sum is:
2
1
And the approximate value is:
0.5
Here are the values in the requested format:
#problem: \sum_{x=1}^{10} \left( \sin(4\pi x) - \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)}{2} \right)
#solution: \frac{1}{2}
#evalf_value: 0.5
