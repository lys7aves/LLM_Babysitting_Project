The OCR process did not result in an accurate extraction of the mathematical expression from the image. I will attempt a different approach to interpret the expression manually and provide the LaTeX representation, exact solution, and an approximate value.
Let's proceed with manually interpreting the expression. 
The OCR has still not provided a clear extraction of the mathematical expression from the image. Therefore, I will proceed to interpret the expression visually and manually transcribe it into LaTeX syntax, solve it, and provide an approximate numerical value. Please hold on while I work on this. 
I have visually inspected the images you've provided, and I can now manually transcribe the mathematical expression into LaTeX syntax, solve it, and give an approximate value.
The LaTeX syntax for the given mathematical expression is:
#problem:
(
π
2
+
2
81
)
2
⎝
⎛
π
πsin(
2
πcos(
2
π
)
)
−9cos(
2
π
)
⎠
⎞
Now let's calculate the exact solution and the approximate value.
The exact solution to the provided mathematical expression is 0. This is because the cosine of 
π/2 is 0, which simplifies the numerator of the fraction to 0, making the entire expression equal to 0 regardless of the denominator.
Here are the results in the requested format:
#problem: \frac{ \left( \frac{ \pi \sin \left( \frac{\pi \cos(\frac{\pi}{2})}{2} \right) }{ \pi } - 9 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) \right) }{ \left( \frac{2}{\pi} + \frac{81}{2} \right)^2 }
#solution: 0
#evalf_value: 0.0
Since the exact value is 0, the approximate value is also 0.0.
