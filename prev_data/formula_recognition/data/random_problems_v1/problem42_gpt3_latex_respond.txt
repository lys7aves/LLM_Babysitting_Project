It seems there is a technical issue preventing me from calculating the sum and generating the LaTeX syntax directly. However, I can explain how you would approach solving this and express it in LaTeX.
The given expression is the sum from 
x=1 to 
x=10 of 
cos(
2
πcos(
2
πx
)
).
The LaTeX syntax for this expression would be:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
To solve this problem, you would typically use a symbolic computation software like SymPy in Python to evaluate the sum. Since the current system is experiencing difficulties, I recommend using such a software on your local machine to obtain the answer.
In LaTeX syntax, the expression is:
css
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} \cos\left(\frac{\pi \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)}{2}\right)
I'm unable to provide the answer due to the technical issue, but you can calculate it using the provided LaTeX syntax in a symbolic computation tool.
