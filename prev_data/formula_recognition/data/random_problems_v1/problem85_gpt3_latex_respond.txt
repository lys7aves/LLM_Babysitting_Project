To express the given mathematical expression in LaTeX syntax, we need to carefully transcribe all the elements in the image. The image shows a summation with an upper limit of 10 and a lower limit of 
x=1. Inside the summation, there is a fraction with 
πcos in the numerator and another fraction in the denominator. The fraction within the denominator has 
πcos
x
 in the numerator and 
2 in the denominator, and this entire fraction is added to another fraction with 
πsin(
2
πx
) in the numerator and 
2 in the denominator.
