The OCR result from the image isn't very clear. I will attempt to interpret the mathematical expression based on the OCR result and visually inspecting the image. Then, I'll provide the LaTeX syntax for the expression and solve the problem.
After interpreting the image, I'll write the code to express it in LaTeX syntax and calculate the answer. 
In the LaTeX syntax, the expression is 
∑
x=1
10
(sin(
2
πx
)+cos(
2
πx
)). The Answer is approximately 
6.66×10
−16
, which is effectively zero within the precision limits of floating-point arithmetic. This result is expected because the sine and cosine functions are orthogonal over a period, and their sum over whole number multiples of 
2
π
 will cancel out.
