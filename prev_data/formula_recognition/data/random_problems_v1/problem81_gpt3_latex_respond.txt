The OCR output contains inaccuracies typical of interpreting mathematical expressions, which are often challenging for OCR software due to the complexity and similarity of symbols used in such notation. However, I can provide a probable LaTeX interpretation based on common patterns in mathematical expressions and the partial output received.
The expression seems to be a summation from 
x=1 to 
10 of a sine function that includes a fraction inside the sine, and another fraction outside of it. The inner fraction seems to contain a linear term in 
x and possibly an addition of two terms involving cosine functions. The outer fraction seems to be a constant.
Let's correct and interpret the expression manually. Given the typical appearance of such expressions and the OCR's partial success, the LaTeX expression could be:
x=1
∑
10
sin(
2
πsin(
2
x
)+cos(
2
πx
+
2
9
)
)
To solve this, I'll evaluate the summation numerically since it doesn't seem to have a closed-form solution. 
In the LaTeX syntax, the expression is 
∑
x=1
10
sin(
2
πsin(
2
x
)+cos(
2
πx
+
2
9
)
). The answer is approximately 1.422.
