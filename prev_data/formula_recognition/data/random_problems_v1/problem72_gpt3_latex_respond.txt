It appears that the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process did not successfully recognize the text in the image. This can happen due to various reasons such as the complexity of the image, the font used for the mathematical expressions, or the quality of the image itself.
I will attempt a different approach to extract and interpret the mathematical expression from the image. Let's try enhancing the image before running OCR again. 
The OCR is still unable to accurately recognize the mathematical expression from the enhanced image. Given these circumstances, I will manually interpret the image to provide the LaTeX representation and the solution to the expression.
First, I will analyze the image directly to understand the expression. 
The expression in the image is a fraction within a large parenthesis, with a summation at the numerator and a trigonometric expression at the denominator. Specifically, the numerator is the sum from 
x=1 to 
10 of 
cos(x), and the denominator is 
2cos(
2
π
sin(
2
πcos(
2
π
(
2
x
+5))
)).
In LaTeX syntax, this is represented as:
(
⎝
⎛
2cos(
2
π
sin(
2
πcos(
2
π
(
2
x
+5))
))
∑
x=1
10
cos(x)
⎠
⎞
To solve this expression, we will evaluate the sum in the numerator and the trigonometric expression in the denominator. Let's calculate this.
