It seems there is an issue with the execution of the code. However, I can provide you with the LaTeX syntax and solve the problem manually.
The LaTeX syntax for the given mathematical expression is:
latex
Copy code
\sum_{x=1}^{10} (2x + 7)
To solve this expression, we calculate the sum of the sequence from
x=1 to
x=10. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated by the formula:
Sum=
2
n
×(a
1
+a
n
)
where
n is the number of terms,
a
1
 is the first term, and
a
n
 is the last term.
First, we find the first term
a
1
 when
x=1:
a
1
=2(1)+7=9
Next, we find the last term
a
10
 when
x=10:
a
10
=2(10)+7=27
Now, we find the sum of 10 terms:
Sum=
2
10
×(9+27)=5×36=180
LaTeX syntax is \sum_{x=1}^{10} (2x + 7). The Answer is 180.
